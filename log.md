## 2026-07-24 — Fix: conflicts modal title advertises Esc/q (follow-up to Batch C/D finding #18)

- The v1.5.0 phase 2 doc batch (Batch C/D, finding #18) updated the `:help` line to advertise that the conflicts list closes on "Esc/q" but left the conflicts modal's title string advertising only "Esc" — an inconsistency now fixed.
- Updated `internal/ui/conflicts.go` line 33: conflicts list title now reads `" Conflicts — Enter to resolve · Esc/q to close "` (was `" Conflicts — Enter to resolve · Esc to close "`), matching the documented behavior (the `SetInputCapture` already handles both keys, verified).
- Added regression test `TestConflictsModalTitleAdvertisesQ` in `internal/ui/conflicts_test.go` — verifies the title advertises the `q` close key. Compiles and passes headlessly.
- Files: `internal/ui/conflicts.go`, `internal/ui/conflicts_test.go`.
- Tests: one new `TestConflictsModalTitleAdvertisesQ`; all existing tests still pass.
- Gate: `go build ./...`, `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `gofmt -l internal/ui` all clean.
- No issues.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 2 doc fixes (Batch C/D): help.go cheat sheet — undocumented keys and modal chrome (matrix findings #9–#12, #15–#18)

- Doc-only pass over the `:help` cheat sheet (`internal/ui/help.go`) landing the owner-approved Batch C/D matrix findings; each behavior was verified against the actual key-handling code (`keys.go`, `grab.go`, `bulkops.go`, `treeview.go`, `forms.go`, `list.go`) before the row was written or reworded — no source behavior changed.
- **#16** — split the over-broad `"h j k l / arrows" → "move the highlight"` row: `j`/`k`/arrows genuinely move the highlight everywhere, but `h`/`l` only move between columns where that applies (a drilled day's concurrent events, grid columns) and are inert on the single-column overview lists — confirmed via `tview.List.InputHandler` (`vendor/.../list.go:628-631`), where `KeyLeft`/`KeyRight` only shift `horizontalOffset`, never `currentItem`.
- **#9** — added a "J / K (task tree)" row: bare `J`/`K` jump to a node's first child / its parent, a native tview `TreeView` binding (`treeview.go:839-854`, `treeChild`/`treeParent`) that reaches the tree unintercepted in NORMAL — confirmed distinct from GRAB's `J`/`K` resize (only intercepted inside `handleGrabKey`/`handleBulkGrabKey`) and from `H`/`L` re-parent.
- **#10** — SELECT's `Esc` row now reads `Esc / V`: confirmed in `selection.go`'s `handleSelectKey`, `r == 'V'` while selecting calls `exitSelect()` with the same "Select cancelled" flash as `Esc`.
- **#11** — the `p / P` row now notes "Tasks mode only": `yankpaste.go`'s `paste()` flashes "Switch to a task list (t) to paste" and returns when `a.mode != modeTasks`, so pasting from a calendar/agenda view is blocked.
- **#12** — SELECT's `Space` row now reads "bulk complete tasks in the range — events are skipped, counted": confirmed in `bulkops.go`'s `bulkComplete`, `!t.isTodo` is a `skips.add("event(s)")` continue, not an error.
- **#15** — the grab (`m`) row now notes hour/resize need week/day view: confirmed in `grab.go`'s `grabNudge`, `timed := a.mode == modeCalendar && a.viewMode != viewMonth && !base.AllDay` gates `j`/`k`/`J`/`K`, flashing `grabTimeHint` otherwise.
- **#17** — added a "Tab / Shift-Tab" row to the Forms section: confirmed in `forms.go`, `normalKey` treats `KeyTab`/`KeyBacktab` as `j`/`k`, `drillKey` treats them as `Enter`/its reverse.
- **#18** — `:conflicts` and `?` rows now list their actual close/scroll keys (`Esc/q` close, `j/k/h/l` move for conflicts; `j/k/g/G/h/l`/arrows/PgUp/PgDn scroll, `Esc/q/?` close for help) — confirmed against `conflicts.go`'s `SetInputCapture` + `modalMotionKey`, and `tview.TextView.InputHandler` (`vendor/.../textview.go:1340-1381`). The help modal's own title string was also corrected from "(Esc to close)" to "(Esc/q to close)" — trivially correct, same file. Left `conflicts.go`'s title untouched: out of this batch's file scope (README.md/help.go/main.md only).
- Also carried the Panels & navigation `Enter` row's phase-1 wording one step further: added "no-op on the Agenda board" (the agenda overview list's items carry a `nil` selected-func, so `tview.List`'s `KeyEnter` case is a no-op there) — same root fact as README finding #14 in the entry below.
- Files: `internal/ui/help.go`.
- Tests: none — doc-only change (no `:help` string is asserted against in tests); full gate re-run for the code-compiles/gofmt-clean guarantee (`help.go` is Go source): `go build ./...`, `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `gofmt -l internal/ui` all clean.
- No issues: all eight findings verified true-as-described against current code; nothing needed walking back.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 2 doc fixes (Batch C/D): README keybindings table & prose (matrix findings #8–#12, #14–#17)

- Doc-only pass over `README.md`'s keybindings table and Usage prose landing the owner-approved Batch C/D matrix findings, paired with the `help.go` fix in the entry above; same code verified, no source behavior changed.
- **#8** — `y`/`p` table row split into dedicated `y`/`Y` (cut/copy), `>`/`<` (zoom subtree), and `p`/`P` (paste, now flagged Tasks-mode-only) rows; added a dedicated `i` `!` … row for force-create on an unconfirmed `[?]` calendar (previously prose-only).
- **#9** — added a `J` / `K` (task tree) row (jump to first child / parent), distinct from grab's `J`/`K` resize and `H`/`L` re-parent — see the code citations in the paired help.go entry above.
- **#10** — SELECT's table row now reads "`Esc` or `V` cancels".
- **#11** — the new `p`/`P` row and the "Moving & grabbing" prose paragraph both now say paste is Tasks-mode only, blocked with a hint from a calendar/agenda view.
- **#12** — SELECT's table row now reads "`Space` complete all tasks (events in range are skipped, counted)".
- **#14** — the stale `Enter` row ("dive into the center; cycle a day's events...") corrected to "drill into the center... — drills in only; a drilled day's items are then cycled with j/k/arrows, not Enter" plus a no-op-on-the-Agenda-board clarification (help.go:27 and the hint bar were already correct from phase 1; only README:120 was stale).
- **#15** — the grab (`m`) row and the "Moving & grabbing" prose both now note hour-move/resize need week/day view (month has no time axis).
- **#16** — split the over-broad `↑↓←→ / jkhl → "move the highlight"` row into a `j`/`k`/arrows row (genuinely moves the highlight) and a separate `h`/`l`/arrows row (moves between columns where that applies; inert on the single-column overview lists).
- **#17** — the forms NORMAL/DRILL prose paragraph gained a sentence noting `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` are synonyms for `j`/`k` in NORMAL and for `Enter`/its reverse once drilled into a field.
- Left `main.md` untouched: none of the nine findings named it, and its own keybindings table/prose already read accurately for these cases (verified during triage) — flagging in case a later pass wants it double-checked for full three-doc consistency.
- Files: `README.md`.
- Tests: none — doc-only change; full gate re-run anyway per the task's instructions (README doesn't affect Go compilation, but ran alongside the help.go commit's gate for the same session): `go build ./...`, `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...` all clean.
- No issues: all nine findings verified true-as-described against current code; nothing needed walking back.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 2: mode-adaptive bottom hint bar (matrix findings #3+#13)

- The resting bottom hint bar (`updateStatus`, `internal/ui/render.go`) was one fixed NORMAL string in every mode: it always advertised `f/b prev/next` and `v view` even in Tasks/Agenda mode, where both are silent no-ops (`f`/`b`/`v` are gated `a.mode == modeCalendar` in `app.go`'s key switch) — finding #3. It also had no branch for the Ctrl-W `RESIZE` sub-mode or an open form/modal, both of which fell through to the same misleading NORMAL line — finding #13.
- Made the hint bar mode/context-adaptive:
  - `a.resizing` now shows a dedicated `RESIZE · ←/→ overview · H/L detail · Enter keep · Esc/q cancel` line, matching the wording already used by `help.go`'s Ctrl-W row and `enterResizeMode`'s entry flash.
  - `a.modalOpen()` now shows a dedicated line via the new `modalHints()`: `FORM · Tab/Enter next field · Esc cancel` when the front page is the item-edit/quick-add caret form (`pageForm`) or its nested Custom… recurrence sub-form (`pageRepeat`); a minimal `Esc/q close` fallback for every other modal (help, `:conflicts`, pickers, which-key), which already carry their own inline title/hint text.
  - The resting NORMAL line is now built by `normalHints()` from the active `a.mode`: Calendar mode keeps `f/b prev/next · v view`; Tasks mode swaps in `>/< zoom · H/L indent · z fold` (its own no-ops outside Tasks); Agenda mode gets neither. The shared prefix/suffix and clip-safe ordering (`? help`/`q quit` lead) are unchanged, so Calendar mode's output is byte-identical to the old fixed string.
  - `modalHints()` reads only `a.root.GetFrontPage()` (a `*tview.Pages` accessor, not an app-lock method) — checked the guardrail explicitly: `updateStatus` is not currently called from any `SetDrawFunc` path (the only one in the package is `drawModeIndicator`, which calls `interactionMode()`/`modalOpen()` the same lock-free way), but the new code stays lock-free to match that established pattern regardless.
- TDD, repro-first: `TestNormalHintBarIsModeAdaptive`, `TestResizeHintBar`, `TestFormOpenHintBar` (`internal/ui/hints_test.go`) — all three RED against the unmodified source (fixed string surfaced in every failure), GREEN after the fix. Existing `TestHelpBarOrder`/`TestHelpBarCompletedToggle`/`TestSelectHintBarDoesNotClaimGGEnds` still pass unmodified (Calendar mode's string is unchanged byte-for-byte).
- Extended the display-stress sweep (`internal/ui/displaystress_test.go`, `TestDisplayStress`) per the standing guardrail: the existing `"tasks"` state now also exercises the Tasks-mode-adaptive NORMAL hint bar (noted inline); added a new `modalStates` sub-loop for `"resize"` and `"form-open"` (each modal — swallows every key via `globalKeys` — so each explicitly exits via `exitResizeMode`/Esc before the next state runs, mirroring the existing `selectStates` loop's `a.exitSelect()`).
- Docs: `main.md`'s help-bar paragraph and `README.md`'s status-bar bullet list both gained a concept-level note that the hint bar is mode-adaptive (no key-by-key narration, per the README's own anti-drift rule).
- Files: `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/hints_test.go`, `internal/ui/displaystress_test.go`, `main.md`, `README.md`.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt -l internal/ui` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 2: pin h/l inertness on the conflicts/account modal lists (deferred test hardening)

- A prior refactor made `modalMotionKey` (`internal/ui/keys.go`) translate `h`/`l` to Left/Right for every modal list, including the conflicts list and the `:account` picker — both single-column `tview.List`s, where Left/Right are no-ops. That inertness was never asserted, only implied.
- Extended the existing `TestConflictsListVimKeys` and `TestAccountPickerVimKeys` (`internal/ui/vimkeys_modal_test.go`) to press `h` then `l` after the existing j/k assertions and assert `GetCurrentItem()` is unchanged, mirroring the j/k assertion pattern already there.
- Coverage add, not a behavior change: both extended tests passed immediately, confirming h/l are in fact inert on these lists (no bug found).
- Files: `internal/ui/vimkeys_modal_test.go`.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 2: 'q' closes the account picker and color picker (matrix finding #7)

- `:help`/README promise `q` closes non-form dialogs, and the conflicts list (`internal/ui/conflicts.go`) already honored it. The account picker (`accountPickerList`, `internal/ui/command.go`) and the color/swatch picker (`colorPicker.InputHandler`, `internal/ui/colorpicker.go`) did not: the account picker's `SetInputCapture` only forwarded to `modalMotionKey` (relying on `SetDoneFunc`, which tview fires for Esc only, not 'q'), and the color picker's `InputHandler` switch had an Esc case with no 'q' sibling.
- Mirrored the conflicts-list pattern: the account picker's `SetInputCapture` now checks `ev.Key() == tcell.KeyEscape || ev.Rune() == 'q'` before falling through to `modalMotionKey`, closing via the same `a.closeModal(pageAccount)` its Esc path already used. The color picker's Escape case gained an `|| ev.Rune() == 'q'` alongside it, calling the same `onCancel`.
- The color picker's "Custom hex…" entry hands off to a *separate* `promptInput` modal only after `pageColor` has already closed (`openColorPickerCallback`, `internal/ui/calendar.go`) — the swatch grid itself is the only focusable primitive on that page, so there is no in-picker hex text field for 'q' to be swallowed away from; no focus-based guard was needed (noted with a comment at the new case).
- TDD: `TestAccountPickerQCloses` (`internal/ui/account_test.go`) and `TestColorPickerQCloses` (`internal/ui/colorpicker_test.go`), both RED against the unmodified source (confirmed by stashing `command.go`/`colorpicker.go` and re-running), GREEN after the fix.
- Files: `internal/ui/command.go`, `internal/ui/colorpicker.go`, `internal/ui/account_test.go`, `internal/ui/colorpicker_test.go`.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 2: undo (u) keeps the calendar drill state (matrix finding #5)

- `undoLast` (`internal/ui/edit.go`) called plain `a.refresh(step.selUID)` to rebuild the views after reversing a mutation. Every sibling direct-mutation path (Space-complete's `refreshKeepingDrill(t.uid)`, bulk grab/bulk ops/recurrence-scope mutations) preserves the calendar grid's drill-in (event-cycling) state across the rebuild; `refresh` itself only auto-preserves drill when its `selUID` argument is `""` (the background-sync case) — a non-empty `selUID` (which most undo steps carry, e.g. `"toggle done"`'s `t.uid`) skipped that branch, so undoing while drilled into a calendar day silently kicked the user back out to day navigation.
- Changed `undoLast` to call `a.refreshKeepingDrill(step.selUID)` instead of `a.refresh(step.selUID)` — the same drill-preservation mechanism the sibling direct-mutation paths already use, applied consistently to undo.
- TDD: `TestUndoWhileDrilledKeepsDrill` (`internal/ui/edit_test.go`) drills the calendar grid onto a due-today task, completes it (confirming the sibling Space-complete path keeps the drill, as a setup precondition), then calls `undoLast` and asserts the grid is still drilled. RED against the unmodified `undoLast` (drill state lost after undo), confirmed by re-running against a stashed pre-fix `edit.go`; GREEN after the fix.
- Files: `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/edit_test.go`.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 2: J/K on a grabbed todo flashes feedback instead of a silent no-op (matrix finding #6)

- `grabNudge` (`internal/ui/grab.go`) handled a todo's motion via `taskNudgeDays[r]`, a map with no `J`/`K` entries — so resizing (which only makes sense for an event's end) fell through to `days == 0` and returned with zero feedback, leaving the user unsure whether the keypress landed. Bulk grab already flashes `"Resize doesn't apply to a multi-selection"` for the same class of key-doesn't-fit-the-selection case.
- Added an explicit `J`/`K` check ahead of the `taskNudgeDays` lookup in the todo branch of `grabNudge`, flashing `"Resize doesn't apply to a task's due date"` (mirroring bulk grab's wording/style) before returning. Grabbed-event `J`/`K` resize behavior is untouched — the new check only fires in the `!a.grabIsEvent` branch.
- TDD: `TestGrabResizeOnTodoFlashesInsteadOfSilentNoop` (`internal/ui/grab_test.go`) RED against the unmodified code (status line left unchanged after clearing it pre-nudge), GREEN after the fix; confirmed RED by re-running against a stashed pre-fix `grab.go`. Existing `TestGrabEventMoveResizeCancel`, `TestGrabTaskDueNudge`, `TestGrabKeyWiring` stay green.
- Files: `internal/ui/grab.go`, `internal/ui/grab_test.go`.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 2: bulk grab's task date-shift axis now matches single-item grab (matrix finding #4)

- Confirmed the inconsistency: single-item grab (`grabNudge`, `internal/ui/grab.go`) nudges a task's due date `j`/`k` ±1 day, `h`/`l` ±1 week (README.md:130, the canonical mapping). Bulk grab (`bulkGrabShift`, `internal/ui/bulkgrab.go`) applied the SAME raw `days` delta to every grabbed item regardless of type — `h`/`l` ±1 day, `j`/`k` ±1 week — so a bulk-grabbed task shifted on the opposite axis from a single-item-grabbed one.
- Bulk grab also shifts events in the same call, and single-item grab has no week-axis analog for events (its `j`/`k` nudges by the hour in a timed calendar view instead) — so there was nothing to realign there. Extracted the task mapping into a shared `taskNudgeDays` map (`internal/ui/grab.go`), reused by both `grabNudge` and the new `bulkGrabShift(r rune)` (now keyed on the rune rather than a pre-computed day count) so the two can't drift apart again; added a sibling `eventBulkNudgeDays` map in `bulkgrab.go` holding bulk grab's existing (unchanged) event mapping, so a bulk grab now applies a per-item-type day delta for the same keypress.
- `bulkGrabStatus` and the post-shift flash now name both axes when a selection mixes tasks and events, rather than asserting one mapping that would be wrong for half the selection.
- TDD: `TestBulkGrabTaskAxisMatchesSingleItem` (`internal/ui/bulkgrab_test.go`) RED against the unmodified bulk mapping (`j` shifted a task's due by a week, not a day), GREEN after the fix; existing `TestBulkGrabShiftsMixed`, `TestBulkGrabHelpBarShowsShiftGranularity` stay green (their shifts happen to sum to the same total either way).
- Files: `internal/ui/grab.go`, `internal/ui/bulkgrab.go`, `internal/ui/bulkgrab_test.go`.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 2: deleteCollection's pane-switch hint names the current c/t keys (matrix finding #20)

- `deleteCollection` (`internal/ui/calendar.go`)'s flash for deleting outside the Calendars/Tasks panes read `"Switch to Calendars (1) or Tasks (2) to delete a list"` — `1`/`2` were the pane-focus keys before panel focus moved onto `c`/`t`/`a` (off the number row, freeing digits for vim counts). The stale hint pointed users at keys that no longer do anything.
- Reworded to `"Switch to Calendars (c) or Tasks (t) to delete a list"`, matching the current keybindings table.
- TDD: `TestDeleteCollectionHintNamesCurrentPaneKeys` (`internal/ui/calendar_test.go`) RED against the unmodified string (contained `"(1)"`/`"(2)"`, missing `"(c)"`/`"(t)"`), GREEN after the wording fix; existing `TestDeleteCollectionNeedsCollectionPane` stays green.
- Files: `internal/ui/calendar.go`, `internal/ui/calendar_test.go`.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 2: remove dead h/j/k/l rune cases from calendarView (matrix finding #19)

- `internal/ui/calendarview.go`'s `handleDayMode` and `handleEventMode` each carried a `case tcell.KeyRune: switch ev.Rune() { case 'h'/'j'/'k'/'l': ... }` block duplicating the arrow-key handling right above it. Confirmed unreachable in the running app: `Application.SetInputCapture(a.globalKeys)` sees every key first, and `globalKeys`' `motionArrow` translation (`internal/ui/keys.go`) always converts a letter motion to the matching arrow key and calls `repeatKey` with it, returning `nil` — so a raw `'h'/'j'/'k'/'l'` rune is never forwarded to any focused primitive's own `InputHandler`, calendarView's included.
- Removed both dead rune-case blocks; the arrow-key cases (which do run, fed the translated event by `repeatKey`) are unchanged.
- TDD: `TestCalendarViewLetterMotionsAreNotHandledDirectly` and `TestCalendarViewEventModeLetterMotionsAreNotHandledDirectly` (`internal/ui/calendarview_test.go`) call `cv.InputHandler()` directly with a raw letter rune (bypassing the global layer, the only way to reach the dead code at all) — RED against the unmodified code (the selection/drilled-event index moved), GREEN after removal (no case matches, nothing moves).
- `TestCalendarViewEventDrillJKBoundaries` (`internal/ui/canary_boundaries_test.go`, a pass-11 escaped-canary regression) parametrized over both the KeyRune and arrow-key paths on the premise both "shared the guard" — true only while the dead duplicate existed. Updated to exercise the arrow-key path alone (the one hjkl is always translated into before reaching the grid); the boundary-clamp coverage it locks is unaffected.
- Files: `internal/ui/calendarview.go`, `internal/ui/calendarview_test.go`, `internal/ui/canary_boundaries_test.go`.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 2: grab hint stops telling an already-in-week/day-view user to switch views (matrix finding #2)

- `grabTimeHint` (`internal/ui/grab.go`) fires when a grabbed item isn't "timed" — which is true both when the user isn't in week/day view *and* when the grabbed item is an all-day event. It unconditionally returned `"switch to week/day view (v) to " + action` for calendar mode, so nudging j/k/J/K on a grabbed all-day event while already in week/day view told the user to switch to a view they were already in — an all-day event has no time to change regardless of view.
- `grabTimeHint` now checks `a.grabAllDay` (already tracked on grab entry) first and returns `"all-day events have no time to " + action` in that case, before falling through to the existing mode-aware switch-view wording for genuinely-not-in-week/day-view timed events.
- TDD: `TestGrabTimeHintAllDayEventAlreadyInWeekDayViewDoesNotSuggestSwitching` (`internal/ui/lowfixes_test.go`) RED against the unmodified function (hint named "switch to week/day view" even with `viewMode = viewWeek`), GREEN after the fix; existing `TestGrabTimeHintIsModeAware` stays green.
- Files: `internal/ui/grab.go`, `internal/ui/lowfixes_test.go`.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 2: SELECT hint bar no longer claims gg/G "ends" the range (matrix finding #1)

- The SELECT-mode help bar (`internal/ui/render.go`, the `a.selecting` branch of `updateStatus`) literally read `"gg/G ends"`, but `gg`/`G` in SELECT extend the range to the top/bottom (`gotoTop`/`gotoBottom` stay in effect while selecting) — they never end or exit the mode. This contradicted both the real behavior and `:help`'s own `"extend the range"` wording for the same chord, misleading anyone who read the hint bar.
- Reworded to `"gg/G extend to top/bottom"`, matching the surrounding `"hjkl extend"` phrasing and `:help`'s wording style.
- TDD: `TestSelectHintBarDoesNotClaimGGEnds` (`internal/ui/hints_test.go`) RED against the unmodified string (asserted no `"gg/G ends"` substring and presence of `"gg/G extend"`), GREEN after the wording fix.
- Files: `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/hints_test.go`.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 2: DRY refactor — share motionArrow's j/k translation via modalMotionKey

- The Conflicts list (`internal/ui/conflicts.go`) and account picker (`internal/ui/command.go`) both manually duplicated motionArrow's j/k→Down/Up translation inline in their `SetInputCapture` handlers because modals short-circuit `globalKeys` (where motionArrow normally translates). Created a shared `modalMotionKey` helper that reuses motionArrow's translation table, eliminating the duplication.
- Added `modalMotionKey` in `internal/ui/keys.go` (after `motionArrow`, ~line 164): translates h/j/k/l letter motions via motionArrow, passes through non-motion events and real arrow keys unchanged. Conflicts list's Esc/`q`-close check is preserved above the call; account picker's capture becomes just `return modalMotionKey(ev)`.
- TDD: `TestModalMotionKeyTranslatesLetters` and `TestModalMotionKeyPassesThroughNonMotion` both verify the helper's translation and pass-through behavior; existing `TestConflictsListVimKeys` and `TestAccountPickerVimKeys` remain green.
- Files: `internal/ui/keys.go`, `internal/ui/conflicts.go`, `internal/ui/command.go`, `internal/ui/vimkeys_modal_test.go`.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — Session cleanup: v1.5.0 status recorded, mid-arc notes written

- main.md's v1.5.0 Build Plan subsection gains a Status line: step 0 + gap-closers + phase 1 shipped; phases 2-3 pending.
- notes.md carries the mid-arc entry: phase-2 matrix next (with the workflow-resume caution learned in phase 1), the small cleanup-batch candidates, phase-3 targets, and the release-gate checklist state.
- Swept the session's SDD scratch (task briefs/reports, review packages); no residual worktrees or branches.
- Files: `main.md`, `notes.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — Housekeeping: gofmt drift in internal/model; phase-1 execution wrap

- **gofmt drift fixed**: `internal/model/{recurfield,recurfield_test,recurdecompose_test}.go` were committed unformatted at some point (pre-existing at this arc's base; surfaced by the polish-bundle review's independent gate run). `gofmt -w` applied; no semantic change; model tests green.
- **Phase-1 execution accounting**: the polish bundle's stale-rect double-click guard was applied to BOTH the agenda-board case (the triaged R30 finding) and its same-class sibling, the task-tree case (found vulnerable during implementation, RED-tested first, disclosed in that commit's entry) — recorded here as the explicit disposition for the sibling extension, per the missing-guard-that-a-sibling-has closure practice.
- Files: `internal/model/recurfield.go`, `internal/model/recurfield_test.go`, `internal/model/recurdecompose_test.go`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 1: Ctrl-W cancel restores a collapsed accordion (Batch C, fix 4/4)

- `enterResizeMode` un-collapses the accordion when entered while collapsed (resizing a collapsed column is meaningless), but `exitResizeMode`'s Esc/cancel path only restored the pre-resize widths, not the collapse itself — cancelling out of resize mode left the overview/Detail visible even though the user hadn't touched the accordion at all.
- Added `resizePrevAccordion`, snapshotted in `enterResizeMode`; `exitResizeMode(revert=true)` now calls `a.setAccordion(true)` when it was set, re-collapsing exactly what entry undid. Enter/keep is unchanged — it deliberately leaves the accordion un-collapsed, since the user just chose explicit widths.
- Verified the restore can't be blocked: `setAccordion(true)` refuses only in Agenda mode, but mode can't change while `a.resizing` is true (`globalKeys` routes every key to `handleResizeKey`, which has no mode-switch case, before Tab/Backtick are ever reached) — so an accordion collapsed on entry was necessarily collapsed from a non-Agenda mode, and the cancel-path restore always succeeds.
- TDD: `TestResizeCancelRestoresAccordion` RED against the unmodified `exitResizeMode` (accordion stayed off, Detail/overview stayed visible after cancel), GREEN after the fix; `TestResizeKeepLeavesAccordionUncollapsed` pins the unchanged Enter/keep path.
- Files: `internal/ui/app.go` (new `resizePrevAccordion` field), `internal/ui/keys.go`, `internal/ui/resize_accordion_test.go` (new).
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 1: j/k movement in the Conflicts list and account picker (Batch C, fix 3/4)

- Both `internal/ui/conflicts.go`'s Conflicts list and `internal/ui/command.go`'s `:account` picker are modal `tview.List`s, so `globalKeys`' `motionArrow` translation never reaches them (`globalKeys` returns immediately when `a.modalOpen()`) — they fell back to tview's native List handler, arrows-only, breaking the app-wide "hjkl move the highlight everywhere" promise these two lists were the last holdouts on.
- Both lists now translate `j`/`k` to `KeyDown`/`KeyUp` in their own `SetInputCapture`, returning a synthesized `tcell.EventKey` that then reaches the List's own (native) Down/Up handling — the Conflicts list extends its existing Esc/`q`-close capture; the account picker gains one (it previously had none beyond `SetDoneFunc`'s built-in Esc).
- TDD: `TestConflictsListVimKeys` and `TestAccountPickerVimKeys` both RED against the unmodified lists (`j` left the selection at 0), GREEN after the fix.
- Files: `internal/ui/conflicts.go`, `internal/ui/command.go`, `internal/ui/vimkeys_modal_test.go` (new).
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 1: agenda-board double-click guarded by mode (Batch C, fix 2/4)

- `mouse.go`'s double-click switch had a stale-rect exposure: `a.agenda.InRect(x,y)` is a hidden `tview.Pages` page outside Agenda mode, and `Pages.Draw` skips resizing/redrawing a hidden page entirely, so its `Box` keeps whatever rect it last drew while visible. The single-click case already guarded this with `&& a.mode == modeAgenda`; the double-click case only checked `a.mode == modeAgenda` *inside* the case body (gating the re-select, not the `editSelected()` call after it), so a click landing on the stale rect from another mode still opened the edit form.
- Checked the sibling `a.tree.InRect` double-click case for the same class: `a.tree` is added to the same `a.center` `tview.Pages` the same way (`resize=true, visible=false`), so it has the identical exposure — confirmed with a RED test before fixing. Both cases now guard the whole `case` (`a.tree.InRect(x,y) && a.mode == modeTasks`, `a.agenda.InRect(x,y) && a.mode == modeAgenda`), matching the single-click style.
- TDD: `TestAgendaBoardDoubleClickIgnoredOutsideAgendaMode` and `TestTreeDoubleClickIgnoredOutsideTasksMode` both RED against the unguarded code (double-click opened the form from the wrong mode), GREEN after the fix; existing `TestAgendaBoardDoubleClickEditsRowUnderCursor`/`TestDoubleClickEditsRowUnderCursor` still pass (re-targeting to the clicked row is unaffected).
- Files: `internal/ui/mouse.go`, `internal/ui/dblclick_test.go`.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 1: sp relays the parser's typo warning (Batch C, fix 1/4)

- `sp` (set priority) failed silently to the generic "priority: 1-9 or high/med/low (blank clears)" hint even when the quick-add parser recognized the input as an obvious typo (e.g. `!hgh` for `!high`) — `sd` (set due) already relays `qa.Warnings[0]` in that case, so `sp` was the odd one out.
- `parseSetPriority` now returns a third value, the parser's first warning (if any), reusing the same `model.ParseQuickAdd` call it already made; `setPriorityPrompt` flashes `"priority: " + warning` when present, falling back to the unchanged generic string when the input isn't recognized as a near-miss at all (e.g. punctuation-only garbage).
- TDD: `TestSetPriorityFlashesParserWarning` (RED against the old 2-value signature/behavior — flash was the generic string) now GREEN; `TestSetPriorityFlashesGenericFallback` pins the no-warning fallback path so it can't regress to always-warn.
- Files: `internal/ui/quickfield.go`, `internal/ui/quickfield_test.go` (existing `TestParseSetPriority` updated for the new 3-value signature), `internal/ui/quickfield_warn_test.go` (new).
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt` clean.

## 2026-07-24 — Docs: cross-doc consistency follow-up from the doc-batch review

- The doc-batch reviewer found two sibling-surface inconsistencies left by the sweep's ID scoping: main.md still said `Enter` *cycles* a drilled day's events (main.md:126 + the keybindings-table Enter row) after help.go was corrected, and README's SELECT bullet still carried the un-scoped one-undo-step wording main.md:207 was corrected away from.
- Settled the Enter contradiction against the code directly: `handleDayMode` Enter starts the drill (first item); `handleEventMode` has no Enter case — `j`/`k`/arrows cycle. Both main.md sites now say drill-then-j/k, matching `:help`.
- README's SELECT bullet now carries the same scoping as main.md (yank/copy undone at paste; a stale-interrupted bulk grab keeps landed nudges).
- CLAIMS.md rows LAY-23/KEY-028/RDM-111 annotated with the follow-up rewording.
- Files: `main.md`, `README.md`, `docs/audit/specdiff/CLAIMS.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 1: README + :help spec-diff fix-doc batch (owner triage, Batch B)

- **Lands the README.md + `internal/ui/help.go` half of the owner-triaged spec-diff fixes** — the remaining 7 of 21 confirmed divergences plus the README-side reverse-sweep doc gaps. Every edit corrects the docs toward what the code actually does: (1) a calendar's color tints the calendar grids/agenda/time-grid but not the task tree, scoped off README's "every view" (RDM-47); (2) 2D drilled navigation is week/day time-grid only — the month grid's drill is a 1D item-list walk (RDM-48); (3) `Enter` drills the weekday strip like a text field, `Space` toggles a day only once drilled (RDM-89); (4) the `q`/`Ctrl-C` keybindings-table row rewritten honestly — `q` quits/closes non-form dialogs and is inert inside data-entry forms, `Ctrl-C` force-quits immediately even over an open form, both flush pending changes best-effort (RDM-183); (5) help.go's Enter row no longer claims it cycles a drilled day's events (that's j/k/arrows) — Enter is only the initial dive in (HLP-16); (6) help.go's `e`/`d` recurring-item row split in two — "this & future" is event-only, a recurring task's scope picker offers only this-task/all-tasks (HLP-75/76).
- **Doc-gap additions**: README's Configuration section gains the `password_command` `sh -c` semantics, the chmod-600 warning's Unix-only scope, and the invalid-`[appearance]`-value non-fatal fallback (R18-R20); the `--password` visible-in-`ps`/history caveat next to its CLI example (R21); Managing Calendars gains the `#rrggbb`/`#rrggbbaa` color-form note (R16) and `calendar create`'s `--desc`/`--path` flags (R22); the `--data` flag documented as setting the **parent** data directory, with the cache still under `<data>/<account-id>/` (R23); the six `:` command aliases noted in both README's Usage prose and help.go's Sync & commands section (R10-R15); help.go's Forms row gains `←`/`→` as button-movement aliases (R08) and the RESIZE-mode flash string (`keys.go` `enterResizeMode`) now names `q` alongside `Esc` as cancel, matching help.go's Ctrl-W row (R04).
- **CLAIMS.md bookkeeping correction**: the Batch A commit's row-update script accidentally flipped all 21 IDs' rows (not just its own 14) to `holds` with their fix-doc notes — the individual RDM-47/48/89/183 and HLP-16/75/76 rows were already correct evidence-wise, but the summary table and the "confirmed divergences" prose still listed them as pending. This entry closes that gap: summary counts now read 0 diverges everywhere but CAL's pre-existing unverifiable claim, and the prose states all 21 as landed. No row content itself needed re-editing.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `gofmt`/`goimports` clean on `help.go`/`keys.go`.
- Files: `README.md`, `internal/ui/help.go`, `internal/ui/keys.go`, `docs/audit/specdiff/CLAIMS.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 1: main.md spec-diff fix-doc batch (owner triage, Batch A)

- **Owner-triaged the 962-claim spec-diff's 21 confirmed divergences plus a reverse-sweep doc-gap list** (`docs/audit/specdiff/CLAIMS.md`); this entry lands the main.md half (Batch A) — 14 of the 21 divergences plus the main.md-side doc-gap additions. Every edit corrects main.md toward what the code actually does (verified against the cited file:line, never guessed): (1) `v`/`f`/`b` act on the calendar view and no-op from Tasks/Agenda, only `gt` truly works from any pane (LAY-27); (2) the sync-status examples were fictional glyph+relative-time text — actual rendering is color-coded words with an absolute clock (`synced 3:04pm`, `syncing...`, `offline`, `! N conflict(s)`), fixed in both the prose and the ASCII mockup (LAY-57..60); (3) the task tree expands/collapses on `Enter`/`Space`, not `→`/`←` (TSK-06); (4) the folder checkbox glyph is `[■]`, not `[x]` (TSK-13); (5) quick-add's `#tag` slot is multi-valued/accumulating, the lone exception to first-match-wins (CRT-21); (6) SELECT's bulk-operation bullet now scopes bulk grab's partial-keep-on-stale exception and states yank/copy pushes no undo step (MOV-56/57); (7) pane-width clamping is attributed to the app's own clamp helpers, not `Flex.ResizeItem` (MOV-91); (8) the Ctrl-arrow keybindings-table row had narrow/widen swapped (KEY-020/021); (9) the Space table row now states the drilled-event exception already correct in the prose (KEY-047).
- **Doc-gap additions** (reverse-sweep R-numbers, main.md-side): the Custom… sub-form paragraph's stale "static, no dynamic rebuild" sentence rewritten to point at the live post-build redesign (R09); `:account` added to the `:` commands list, plus a new sentence naming the six accepted command aliases (R17, R10-R15); the accordion is explicitly unavailable in Agenda mode (R02); `q` is named alongside `Esc` as the resize sub-mode's cancel key, in both prose and the table (R04); a day-range SELECT is capped at 366 days from the anchor (R05); `←`/`→` documented as aliases for `h`/`l` in the DRILL-mode form NORMAL bullet (R08); Calendars rows now show an item-count suffix like `(5e 3t)` (R25); the general status line's red `!N load error(s)` ingest-error surfacing is documented (R26); the Detail pane's pre-drill day-summary is documented (R27); the mouse's full inertness during SELECT/GRAB/resize (wheel included) is documented (R28/R29).
- **CLAIMS.md**: the 14 fixed IDs' rows flip `diverges` → `holds` with a `fix-doc landed 2026-07-24: …` evidence note; the region summary table and the "confirmed divergences" line updated to reflect 14 closed / 7 still pending (the README.md + help.go batch).
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`).
- Files: `main.md`, `docs/audit/specdiff/CLAIMS.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 phase 1: spec-diff sweep complete; claim inventory committed

- **The exhaustive two-direction spec↔program diff ran** (design phase 1): 962 behavioral claims extracted from main.md's design sections, README.md, and the `:help` cheat sheet, each verified against the code by a parallel agent fan-out; a six-lens reverse sweep hunted undocumented user-visible behavior; every claimed divergence was adversarially re-verified by an independent skeptic before recording.
- **Results**: 940 claims hold · **21 confirmed divergences pending owner triage** · 1 unverifiable (a purpose statement). Six verifier-claimed divergences were skeptic-refuted and recorded as holds. The reverse sweep produced 30 doc-gap/behavior findings (6 undocumented `:` command aliases, undocumented CLI flags/config semantics, missing mouse/mode-swallow docs, and a few candidate code fixes), queued for the same triage.
- **Operational note**: the run hit the session usage limit mid-refute; a workflow resume then cache-missed the whole verify layer (verify prompts embed extractor output, which re-serialized differently on restore) and was stopped early — the 14 outstanding skeptics re-ran as a small self-contained workflow instead. Two verifier verdict-flips from the partial re-run (KEY-047, TSK-13) were adjudicated the same way (both confirmed).
- **Deliverable**: `docs/audit/specdiff/CLAIMS.md` (new) — the full 962-row ledger with per-region tables, statuses, and evidence. No code or doc fixes in this increment: divergences land only after per-finding owner triage, per the design.
- Files: `docs/audit/specdiff/CLAIMS.md` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — Whole-branch review of the v1.5.0 step-0/gap-closer arc; COVERAGE.md phase-3 note widened

- **Final whole-branch review** (base `82e68d8` → `046443c`, all five plan tasks): verdict **ready to merge**, no Critical or Important findings. The race-test invariant, the accordion's interaction with every adjacent mode/resize path, and both `moveSubtreeOps` callers' rollback behavior were traced explicitly and held.
- **One Minor taken now**: the COVERAGE.md phase-3 deferral in the SELECT-mode row named only the `!remaining` `Delete` branch; the same-class unconditional rollback-`Restore` path (shared ops/rollback in `yankpaste.go`, also `reparentOps`) is now named alongside it so the reconcile-matrix audit sweeps both.
- **Deferred Minors, recorded for the v1.5.0 phase-2 sweep**: (1) the agenda double-click path with a stale board rect outside Agenda mode is untested pre-existing behavior (a key×context matrix cell); (2) `setMode`'s accordion restore does a redundant Detail resize on the Agenda transition; (3) the `detailOn`-restore snippet appears 3× — candidate `restoreDetailWidth()` helper; (4) note-only: `itemAtY` uses the last draw's scroll (benign one-event window).
- Files: `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — Detail-pane accordion (gap-closer B)

- `+`/`-` (outside the week/day hour-zoom) now collapses/restores the Detail pane together with the overview column — making main.md's Pane-sizing wording true and resolving the v1.5.0 design's seed finding (the Future-versions bullet contradicting it is removed). Restore honors `detailOn`, so Agenda mode's independent Detail-hiding is unaffected; `setMode`'s accordion auto-restore brings Detail back too.
- TDD: `internal/ui/accordion_detail_test.go` (new) — collapse/restore round-trip and the setMode-restore path incl. the Agenda interaction; display-stress gains an `accordion-collapsed` state.
- Docs: `help.go` hint row, README accordion wording, main.md Future-versions bullet removed.
- Full gate green.
- Files: `internal/ui/keys.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/accordion_detail_test.go` (new), `internal/ui/displaystress_test.go`, `internal/ui/help.go`, `README.md`, `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — Agenda board click-to-select + double-click re-target (gap-closer A, part 2)

- `mouseCapture` gains a board case: single left click (Agenda mode) selects the item under the cursor via `agendaList.SetCurrentItem` (its changed func drives the board); double-click re-targets before `editSelected`, closing the pass-16 "edits the already-selected item" trap. Gap rows and the header are inert (`itemAtY` = -1).
- Tests: `TestAgendaBoardClickSelects`, `TestAgendaBoardDoubleClickEditsRowUnderCursor` (`internal/ui/agendaclick_test.go`) — RED first (no board click case / edit landed on the stale selection), GREEN after wiring. The task brief's test code hardcoded click x=10; the always-visible left overview column (calendars/tasklists/agendaList) tiles x 0..25 for the full pane height at the default 26-wide left column, so that x never reaches the board's rect (x≥26) regardless of wiring — verified by a manual x=30 probe that the wiring itself was correct before touching the test. Fixed the tests to derive the click column from the board's own rect (`b.GetRect()`) instead of the fixed literal; row math and assertions otherwise unchanged from the brief.
- Docs: README Usage mouse sentence, main.md Mouse section + Future-versions bullet trimmed to just the calendar-grid full-cell click mapping, COVERAGE.md mouse-row limitation note closed.
- Full gate green.
- Files: `internal/ui/mouse.go`, `internal/ui/agendaclick_test.go`, `README.md`, `main.md`, `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — Agenda board: layoutBlocks extraction + itemAtY hit-testing (gap-closer A, part 1)

- Extracted `agendaBoard.Draw`'s inline block layout into `layoutBlocks()` and added `itemAtY(screenY)` — screen row → item index, -1 on header/gap/outside/past-last — sharing the exact layout math so hit-testing can't disagree with what was drawn (the `treeNodeAtY` precedent). Rendering unchanged.
- Tests: `internal/ui/agendaclick_test.go` (new) — a full-pane row walk asserting both sides of every window, plus empty-board and scrolled-board cases. The test fixture's own `now` date had to move off 2026-07-05 (the store fixture's `meeting.ics` lands there, so an "empty" board wasn't actually empty) and each seeded event needed a unique summary (`putTimedEvent`'s UID is derived from summary alone, so a shared literal collided all events onto one UID) — both fixed in the test file; `layoutBlocks`/`itemAtY` match the brief verbatim.
- Full gate green.
- Files: `internal/ui/agendaboard.go`, `internal/ui/agendaclick_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — Fix: moveSubtreeOps source rewrite version-checked (v1.5.0 step 0)

- The COVERAGE.md-flagged gap: `moveSubtreeOps` (`internal/ui/yankpaste.go`) rewrote a cross-list move's source resource with a bare `store.Put`, silently overwriting a sync pull that updated a co-resident bystander between the loop's Locate and the write. Now `store.PutIfUnchanged` against `loc.Prev` — a mid-move pull fails the move cleanly (all-or-nothing rollback, clipboard kept for retry), matching `reparentOps`.
- The `!remaining` branch's whole-resource `Delete` deliberately unchanged (reconcile-matrix question for the phase-3 audit).
- TDD: `TestMoveSubtreeSourceRewriteDoesNotClobberConcurrentPull` (`internal/ui/movesubtree_clobber_test.go`, new) — one-pull-per-iteration race under `-race`, RED against the bare Put, GREEN after.
- `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md` flag updated to FIXED.
- Full gate green.
- Files: `internal/ui/yankpaste.go`, `internal/ui/movesubtree_clobber_test.go` (new), `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — main.md: v1.5.0 Build Plan subsection (scope planned)

- Replaced the v1.5.0 stub with the owner-settled scope (spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-24-v1.5.0-polish-audit-design.md`): step-0 `moveSubtreeOps` fix, two-direction spec-diff, UI/keymap consistency sweep + two gap-closers, minimum-one deep audit pass.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.5.0 design brainstormed and spec written

- Brainstormed the v1.5.0 (polishing & auditing) scope with the owner; all decisions owner-settled: systemic priority-ordered sweeps (spec↔program gaps → UI/keymap consistency → deep audit), exhaustive two-direction spec-diff, both UX gap-closers in scope (agenda-board click-to-select, Detail-pane accordion), minimum one `/audit` pass then best-effort toward convergence, per-finding owner triage, hybrid execution (durable claim inventory + parallel agent fan-out; speed prioritized).
- Step 0 scoped: the flagged `moveSubtreeOps` bare-`Put` data-loss gap is fixed repro-first before the sweeps.
- Seed finding recorded: main.md self-contradicts on whether the `+`/`-` accordion collapses the Detail pane (design text says yes, Future-versions bullet says overview-only).
- Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-24-v1.5.0-polish-audit-design.md` (new). Next: owner spec review, then the main.md `### v1.5.0` Build Plan subsection + implementation plan.
- Files: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-24-v1.5.0-polish-audit-design.md` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — Docs: main.md hardening ledger gains the missing pass-18 line; convergence paragraph rewritten

- **Doc-currency gap found at session startup**: main.md claims its Build Plan carries a one-line summary of *every* hardening pass, but the ledger and the convergence paragraph stopped at pass 17 — pass 18 (2026-07-21: first audit of the v1.1.0 multi-account surfaces + the deep sync-core TOCTOU re-sweep; HIGH 2 · MED 1, all fixed; 4/4 escaped canaries, all closed) existed only in `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md` and `docs/audit/passes/PASS-18.md`.
- **main.md ledger**: added the pass-18 bullet after pass 17, in the ledger's compressed style — the two HIGHs (the O(depth²) nested-inline-table config decode hanging startup inside the 4 MiB read cap, fixed via `checkNestingDepth`; the `store.CommitPush` mid-push-delete resurrection silently losing a user delete, fixed by honoring `cur==nil` + advancing the tombstone ETag), the MED (`:config` reload discarding the re-parsed account list, fixed via `ConfigReload.Accounts`/`ActiveAccount`), and the four closed canaries. Fix status taken from COVERAGE.md (the PASS-18.md report records the findings as-found/unfixed; the fixes and canary closures landed 2026-07-21 per the ledger).
- **main.md convergence paragraph rewritten in place**: the HIGH trend extends … → 0 (17) → 2 (18); criterion 2 (two consecutive no-HIGH passes) reset from one back to zero; the second consecutive 4/4 canary-escape pass noted; next-pass targets updated (the reconcile-vs-concurrent-pull matrix beyond the `CommitPush` window, plus the post-pass-18 feature surface — v1.2.0 grammar, v1.3.0 recurrence primitives, v1.4.0 SELECT/bulk-ops incl. the flagged `moveSubtreeOps` bare-`Put`). The stale "one more re-sweep earns the streak" estimate is gone; the permanently-accepted-gaps list is unchanged.
- **docs/audit/COVERAGE.md**: the "live two-account end-to-end switch-and-sync" residual-risk bullet was stale (written while the CalDAV server was offline) — marked RESOLVED, since the owner live-verified two-account sync 2026-07-22 during the v1.1.0 release verification.
- Docs-only change; no code touched. Full gate run anyway and green: `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`.
- Files: `main.md`, `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.4.0 released — flip main.md status, session cleanup

- **v1.4.0 — SELECT mode released by the owner** (tag `v1.4.0` at `5877c39`, the branch tip including the same-day grab help-bar fix). Verified before flipping docs: `ai-workspace` == `origin/ai-workspace` == `main` == `origin/main` == the tag commit — the merge to `main` and the tag are the owner's actions, per the branching rules.
- **main.md updated in place**: Current State now reads v1.0.0–v1.4.0 released, v1.5.0 (final polishing & auditing) is the current phase and the last planned release for the foreseeable future; the `### v1.4.0` Build Plan status line flipped from "Not yet released" to released 2026-07-24, folding in the whole-branch-review summary and the help-bar discoverability fix.
- Release notes (markdown) generated for the GitHub release from the `v1.3.0..ai-workspace` commit range.
- End-of-session cleanup: no residual worktrees/branches/scratch; `notes.md` empty (no mid-arc work).
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — Fix: help bar now reflects grab controls (bulk grab showed stale SELECT hints)

- **Discoverability finding (bulk grab granularity)**: bulk grab (`V`…`m`) shifts every selected item by whole days (`h`/`l`) and weeks (`j`/`k`) — deliberately a uniform *date-shift*, not single-item grab's ±hour event nudge — but the only surface that stated this was the transient entry flash. The always-visible help bar (`a.hints`) never had a grab branch in `updateStatus`, so during a **bulk** grab (which nests inside SELECT, keeping `a.selecting` true) each nudge's `refreshKeepingDrill`→`updateStatus` repainted the bar to the SELECT line — `SELECT · hjkl extend · …` — which is actively wrong mid-grab (`hjkl` shifts dates, it no longer extends the range) and names no granularity. Single-item grab showed the ordinary `hjkl move` global line, also not grab-aware.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/render.go`): `updateStatus` gains a grab branch, checked **before** the `selecting` branch (bulk grab has both flags true). Single grab → the existing context-aware `grabStatus()` (`±hour`/`±day`/`±week`/resize per context); bulk grab → a new `bulkGrabStatus()`. The help bar now shows the active grab's controls + granularity for the whole grab, and the stale "hjkl extend" line is gone during bulk grab. Behavior (the shifts themselves) unchanged — this is a hint/discoverability fix only.
- **`bulkGrabStatus()`** (`internal/ui/bulkgrab.go`, mirrors `grabStatus()`): `GRAB ×N · h/l ±day · j/k ±week · Enter keep · Esc cancel`, now shared by `startBulkGrab`'s entry flash and the help bar so the two can't drift.
- **TDD**: `internal/ui/grabhints_test.go` (new) — `TestGrabHelpBarShowsEventGranularity` (single event grab in week view → help bar names `±hour`, not the ordinary controls line) and `TestBulkGrabHelpBarShowsShiftGranularity` (bulk grab → help bar names `±day`/`±week`, no `extend`). RED confirmed first: single grab showed the global `hjkl move` line, bulk grab showed the `SELECT · hjkl extend · …` line verbatim; GREEN after the `updateStatus` branch.
- Full gate green: `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`, `gofmt -l` clean on touched files.
- Files: `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/bulkgrab.go`, `internal/ui/grabhints_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — Docs: restructure main.md SELECT paragraph; entry-focus + bare-0 notes

- **Final whole-branch review, item 4 (docs)**: main.md's "SELECT mode: multi-select and bulk operations" section was one ~250-word paragraph, violating the house style ("long sections can almost always be broken up"). Restructured in place into a short lead sentence + 5 bullets — contexts+entry, the motion/swallow contract, bulk operations + skip taxonomy + truthful counts, bulk grab semantics, exit/nesting (incl. the empty-day-vs-lost-anchor distinction) — every fact from the original paragraph preserved, none moved elsewhere.
- **Ripple from Fixes 1–2**: the entry bullet now states SELECT requires the tree/grid itself focused, not an overview list (Fix 1); the swallow-contract bullet now names the bare-`0` swallow alongside the modified-arrow swallow, with the count-continuation exception (Fix 2). `internal/ui/help.go`'s `:help` Select section `V` row gets the same entry-focus note.

## 2026-07-24 — Test: N>1 pasteMultiRoot copy + cross-list move coverage

- **Final whole-branch review, item 3 (test gap)**: `TestBulkYankPasteUnder` was the only test exercising `pasteMultiRoot` (`internal/ui/yankpaste.go`), and it only covered the same-list reparent branch — the copy branch (`copySubtreeOps`) and the cross-list move branch (`moveSubtreeOps`) had no N>1 coverage at all.
- **`TestBulkYankCopyPasteMultiRoot`** (`internal/ui/bulkops_test.go`): `Y` two roots — one carrying a child, folded in implicitly by the visible-range dedupe — paste into the same list. Asserts both roots copy with fresh UIDs, the child's copy re-parents onto its own copied root (not the original), the originals are untouched (same UID, same parent), and one `undoLast()` removes every copy.
- **`TestBulkYankCrossListMoveMultiRoot`**: `y` the same two-root/one-child shape, paste into a second writable list ("work", made a task list by seeding one VTODO into it — the `TestStickyWorksOnNonFirstList` idiom — then switched to via `SetCurrentItem`, whose changed-callback rebuilds the tree). Asserts both subtrees recreate in the target and are gone from the source, as one undo step that restores everything.
- **A cut preserves UID/identity — a copy doesn't**: `moveSubtreeOps` relocates the *same* UID to the destination calendar (only the moved root's parent link changes); `copySubtreeOps` mints fresh UIDs. The cross-list test's first draft assumed move behaved like copy (a "new UID at the destination, old one gone") and failed — a test-authoring mistake, not a production bug (confirmed by dumping the post-paste store state before touching anything); fixed by asserting `store.Locate(sameUID).CalID` moved from the source to the target, not by hunting for a fresh UID.
- Both tests pass against the existing `pasteMultiRoot`/`copySubtreeOps`/`moveSubtreeOps` code unchanged — no production code touched.

## 2026-07-23 — Fix: swallow bare 0 in SELECT (hour-zoom reset leaked through)

- **Final whole-branch review, item 2 (Important)**: `handleSelectKey` passed every digit through unconditionally (`r >= '0' && r <= '9'`), including a bare `0` — which, with no pending count, falls to `globalKeys`' `case '0'` → `resetHourZoom()`, a week/day-grid layout+persisted-state mutation. Same class as the already-fixed modified-arrow leak (`TestSelectSwallowsModifiedArrows`).
- **Fix**: split the digit case in `handleSelectKey` — `1-9` still pass through unconditionally (a count can only start with a nonzero digit); `0` passes through only when `a.pendingCount > 0` (continuing a count, e.g. the `0` in "10j"), mirroring `globalKeys`' own `r == '0' && a.pendingCount > 0` condition. A bare `0` is now swallowed (`return nil`).
- **TDD**: `TestSelectSwallowsBareZero` (`internal/ui/selection_test.go`, beside `TestSelectSwallowsModifiedArrows`) — week/day view, selecting, a non-auto `a.hourRows`: a bare `0` leaves `hourRows` unchanged and SELECT still active; `"1","0","l"` (day-mode navigates by h/l, not j/k) still moves the anchor 10 days, proving a count-continuing `0` still reaches motion. RED confirmed by stashing the production change (`hourRows` reset to 0, i.e. the leak), GREEN after restoring it.

## 2026-07-23 — Fix: V from an overview panel must flash a hint, not enter SELECT

- **Final whole-branch review, item 1 (Important)**: `enterSelect` (`internal/ui/selection.go`) gated only on `a.mode`, but `setMode` focuses the overview lists (`a.calendars`/`a.tasklists`), not the tree/grid — and motion goes to whatever's focused. So `c V` (or `t V`) right after a plain mode switch anchored a range that ordinary `j`/`k` could never extend (they moved the overview highlight instead), silently bricking the feature from its most natural entry point.
- **Fix**: `enterSelect` now requires the actual selection surface focused before anchoring — `a.tree` for the tree context, `a.calendarPrimitive()` for both calendar contexts (drilled and un-drilled) — matching the same `a.tv.GetFocus()` gate `deleteContextual` (`keys.go`) already uses. Focus elsewhere flashes the existing "Nothing to select here" hint and leaves `selecting` false.
- **TDD**: `TestSelectEntryRequiresSelectionSurfaceFocus` (`internal/ui/selection_test.go`) — calendar mode with `a.calendars` focused (the state after plain `c`) and tasks mode with `a.tasklists` focused both flash and stay out of SELECT; the same modes with the grid/tree explicitly focused still enter. RED against the pre-fix `enterSelect` (both leak cases would have set `selecting = true`), GREEN after.
- **Test-fixture ripple**: every existing test that called `enterSelect()`/pressed `V` right after `setMode(modeCalendar)`/`setMode(modeTasks)` (or a bare `reDrill`) without an explicit focus change relied on the old no-gate behavior — updated to `a.setFocus(a.calendarPrimitive())`/`a.setFocus(a.tree)` first, matching how focus actually reaches the grid/tree in the real app (`a.calendars`/`a.tasklists`' `SetSelectedFunc`, Enter). Touched: `selection_test.go`, `selectionvisuals_test.go`, `bulkops_test.go`, `bulkgrab_test.go`, and `displaystress_test.go`'s five `select-*` stress states (which, without the fix, would have silently stopped exercising SELECT's draw paths at all).

## 2026-07-23 — Docs: SELECT ripple completeness (empty-day range, modified arrows, skip taxonomy)

- **Reviewer follow-up on the v1.4.0 docs-ripple task**: four shipped behaviors were verified accurate during the first pass but never actually written into a doc. Closed all four; nothing else changed.
- **main.md's SELECT-mode paragraph** gains, in place: (1) a contrast clause — a *lost* anchor (remote delete, emptied drilled day) clears the selection, but an anchored day range spanning only empty days is still a **valid** selection since a date anchor can't itself vanish (extend `f`/`b` toward a day with items); (2) "swallows context-switch and edit keys" widened to name **modified** motion keys explicitly (Ctrl-arrows can't sneak a pane resize in mid-select); (3) a truthful-counts clause — the skip filter runs *before* delete/yank's subtree-absorption dedupe, so the confirm/summary count always matches what's actually acted on (stated as behavior, not the two-pass implementation detail).
- **Skip taxonomy**: added the missing `folders with open subtasks` category (bulk complete only) to main.md's skip list and to `:help`'s Select section skips row.
- **`:help` motion row**: added `f`/`b` (period shift) to the Select section's motion keys — it passes through `handleSelectKey` like `hjkl`/`gg`/`G` but was omitted from the cheat sheet.
- Full gate green: `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`, `gofmt -l` clean on `internal/ui/help.go`.
- Files: `main.md`, `internal/ui/help.go`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.4.0: docs ripple (README, :help, main.md build record, coverage ledger)

- **Task 8 (final) of the v1.4.0 SELECT-mode build**: documentation only, no interface changes. Verified every claim against the shipped code (`internal/ui/selection.go`, `bulkops.go`, `bulkgrab.go`, `handleSelectKey`/`handleBulkGrabKey`/`globalKeys`) rather than the original task-8 brief/plan.
- **README.md**: keybindings table gains a `V` row (the brief's exact wording) plus a missing `m` (grab) row it turned out the table never had — `V`'s cell references `m` directly, so the table would otherwise send a reader to a key it doesn't document. New **Selecting multiple items** prose paragraph (mirrors the **Moving & grabbing** paragraph's format) states the SELECT-is-a-mode-like-GRAB concept only; the table carries the keys.
- **`internal/ui/help.go`**: new **Select (multi-select)** section in the `?`/`:help` cheat sheet, mirroring the existing Grab section's row format — entry, motion, the four bulk-op keys, a skip-categories row, and Esc's nested-vs-outer behavior.
- **main.md**, three in-place edits: (1) keybinding table `V` row (table-voice condensed); (2) a new **SELECT mode: multi-select and bulk operations** design paragraph after the Grab-mode section — anchor→cursor range, the three contexts, the derived-not-stored range architecture, bulk-op semantics (skip counts, one undo step, all-or-nothing), bulk grab as a uniform date-shift, and the DRILL→SELECT→GRAB mode nesting; (3) the `### v1.4.0` Build Plan subsection flipped from "(planned)" to the build record — a status line (implemented 2026-07-23, gates green, **not yet released**), the settled decisions in two sentences (mode composition over a parallel enum; the shared materialize→filter→execute→undo shape), and a build-steps list in log-summary style (detail stays in `log.md`, full spec in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-23-select-mode-design.md`) — plus the RELATED-TO cycle-hang bugfix recorded as a **Build-time finding** paragraph. **Current State** section updated: v1.4.0 implemented on `ai-workspace` pending owner review/release, v1.5.0 next.
- **`docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`**: new surface row — `SELECT mode + bulk ops + bulk grab` (`internal/ui`), marked **never** audited, following the ledger's existing row format. Its notes record (a) the RELATED-TO cycle-hang found+fixed during the build (the "missing-guard-that-a-sibling-has" shape, same class as pass 17's Import/reconcileCalendar and resolveDateTime findings), already fixed and not left open; and (b) a pre-existing adjacent finding flagged for the next hardening pass, not fixed here: `moveSubtreeOps`'s source-side rewrite (`internal/ui/yankpaste.go`) still commits via a bare `store.Put` rather than `store.PutIfUnchanged`, a gap that predates v1.4.0 but is now also reached by the new multi-root paste path.
- **Self-review (drift check)**: re-read `handleSelectKey`, `bulkops.go`, `bulkgrab.go`, and `globalKeys`/`resolvePrefix` line-by-line against every key/behavior claim written above — no drift found; every documented key, skip category, and mode-nesting claim traces to an exact line in the shipped code.
- Full gate green: `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`, `gofmt -l` clean on touched files.
- Files: `README.md`, `internal/ui/help.go`, `main.md`, `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.4.0: SELECT bulk grab

- **Task 7 of the v1.4.0 SELECT-mode build**: bulk grab (`m` in SELECT) — a uniform date-shift over the whole range, GRAB nested inside SELECT. New `internal/ui/bulkgrab.go`: `bulkGrabItem` (identity + pre-grab snapshot), `startBulkGrab` (filters recurring events / undated tasks / read-only / missing, counted via the existing `bulkSkip`), `handleBulkGrabKey` (h/l ±1 day, j/k ±1 week, arrows mirror them, J/K flash "doesn't apply to a multi-selection"), `bulkGrabShift` (per-item `PutIfUnchanged` against a fresh `Locate`, rolling back this nudge's own writes on any failure/staleness), `commitBulkGrab` (one compound undo step, exits GRAB **and** SELECT), `cancelBulkGrab` (restores every pre-grab snapshot newest-first, returns to SELECT with the range intact), `abortBulkGrabStale` (keeps earlier completed nudges as one undo step, ends both modes). `app.go` gains `bulkGrab`/`bulkGrabMoved` state and routes `globalKeys`' grab branch on `len(a.bulkGrab) > 0`; `selection.go` wires `'m'` (replacing the stub).
- **Recurring todos participate, recurring events don't** — shifting a recurring todo's due moves the series anchor exactly like single-item grab; a recurring event's day-move needs `ReanchoredRecurrence` handling that has no coherent bulk meaning (which occurrence? which rule?), so it's filtered out and counted, mirroring the settled SELECT rule bulk-delete/yank already use.
- **Two real bugs found via TDD (RED first), not brief deviations** — both root-caused to the same mechanism: `refresh()`/`refreshKeepingDrill()` end with their own `syncSelectionVisuals()` call, which runs against the grid's *current* drill state — and a nudge that moves every grabbed item off the drilled day empties it, so the grid's `reDrill` legitimately un-drills (nothing left to cycle through) until the caller redrills it onto the restored data. Two fixes: (1) `syncSelectionVisuals` now skips its "range vanished → exit SELECT" check while `len(a.bulkGrab) > 0` — the transient un-drilled window during an active bulk grab is a rebuild-ordering artifact, not an actual change to what's selected; (2) `cancelBulkGrab` captures the pre-grab drill position (`app.go`'s new `bulkGrabDay`/`bulkGrabIdx`/`bulkGrabDrilled`, set once in `startBulkGrab`) and explicitly re-drills onto it after restoring the data — deliberately not `refreshKeepingDrill`, whose "keep" would trust the grid's already-collapsed mid-grab state instead; `a.bulkGrab` is kept populated until *after* that redrill so guard (1) still holds across the window.
- **TDD**: RED (`go test ./internal/ui/ -run 'TestBulkGrab' -v` → `undefined: a.startBulkGrab`), then the two bugs above surfaced as failures in `TestBulkGrabEscRevertsToSelect` even with the brief's implementation typed in verbatim — root-caused and fixed rather than adjusting the test. `TestBulkGrabShiftsMixed` also asserts (brief's noted extra case) that a committed grab is exactly one undo step and `undoLast` restores both the event and the task. `putRecurringEvent`'s call needed its `rrule` argument the brief's snippet omitted (arg-count drift, not a bug).
- Verified: `go test ./internal/ui/ -run 'TestBulkGrab|TestGrab' -v` (all pass, single-grab suite untouched), `go test ./internal/ui/` and `go test -race ./internal/ui/` pass; full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`, `gofmt -l` clean).

## 2026-07-23 — v1.4.0: SELECT bulk yank + multi-root paste

- **Task 6 of the v1.4.0 SELECT-mode build** — the most invasive step: the clipboard becomes multi-root. `app.yankUID string` → `app.yankUIDs []string` (`internal/ui/app.go`); `a.bulkYank(cut bool)` (`internal/ui/bulkops.go`) puts SELECT's ancestor-deduped range (`bulkDeleteRoots`, reused as-is) on the clipboard; `y`/`Y` wired in `handleSelectKey` (`internal/ui/selection.go`), replacing the flash stubs.
- **`internal/ui/yankpaste.go` restructure**: extracted the loop bodies of `moveSubtree`/`copySubtree` into `moveSubtreeOps`/`copySubtreeOps` (`(uid/rootUID, targetParent, ..., ops *[]undoOp, rollback *[]func()) error`) — the write half only, with `guardWrite`/`pushUndo`/`flash` left to callers. The single-item wrappers (`moveSubtree`, `copySubtree`, `reparentTo`) are **unchanged in behavior**, still guard their own calendar(s), build their own private `ops`/`rollback` pair, and call the extracted core — `paste()`'s single-root branch (`len(yankUIDs) == 1`) still calls them directly, byte-for-byte the original code path. A `len(yankUIDs) > 1` clipboard instead takes the new `pasteMultiRoot`: every root is validated (existence, self/subtree cycle guard, read-only cross-list source) **before any write**, then all roots move/copy under **one shared `ops`/`rollback` pair** — a failure on root N rolls back roots 1..N-1, success pushes exactly one undo step, and the clipboard persists for another paste.
- **New `reparentOps`** (same-list cut, multi-root path only): uses `store.PutIfUnchanged` against the Locate'd `Prev` — deliberately stricter than the legacy single-item `reparentTo`'s bare `Put`, per the version-check guardrail (new code follows it; fixing the pre-existing single-item path is out of scope here).
- **staticcheck caught a design snag mid-implementation**: an earlier draft had `paste()` always call the extracted cores directly (even for one root), which left `copySubtree` (and would have left `reparentTo`) as dead code (U1000) — moveSubtree stayed "used" only because two tests call it directly. Resolved by branching `paste()` on root count instead of unifying the single/multi paths, restoring the single-item wrappers to their original call sites.
- **TDD**: RED first (`go test ./internal/ui/ -run 'TestBulkYank|TestBulkPaste' -v` → `undefined: a.bulkYank`, `a.yankUIDs`), then GREEN. `TestBulkYankDedupesSubtree` (brief's test, adapted): `selectTreeRangeAll` selects every visible tree row, and the shared vdir fixture seeds its own top-level "grocery" task alongside whatever the test creates — a whole-tree range picked that up as an unrelated third root, breaking the test's exact-count assertion. Bounded the range to the folder's own two rows (`selectTreeByUID` anchor/cursor) instead, matching the test's stated intent (subtree dedup, not whole-tree selection) without weakening the assertion.
- Legacy yank/paste tests (`internal/ui/yankpaste_test.go`, `internal/ui/coresident_move_test.go`) updated mechanically: `a.yankUID` → `a.yankUIDs` (one-element slice), assertions unchanged in strength.
- Verified: `go test ./internal/ui/ -run 'TestBulkYank|TestBulkPaste|TestYank|TestPaste|TestMove|TestCopy|TestCoResident|TestSelect' -v` (all pass) and `go test ./internal/ui/... -race` pass; full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`, `gofmt -l` clean).
- Files: `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/bulkops.go`, `internal/ui/bulkops_test.go`, `internal/ui/coresident_move_test.go`, `internal/ui/selection.go`, `internal/ui/yankpaste.go`, `internal/ui/yankpaste_test.go`.

## 2026-07-23 — Bugfix: bulk-delete ancestor walk could hang on malformed RELATED-TO cycles

- **Reviewer-found on Task 5** (`internal/ui/bulkops.go`'s `bulkDeleteRoots`), one Critical + one Important, same root cause: the ancestor-absorption walk trusted `parentUID` data it has no business trusting.
- **Critical**: the walk `for p := parentOf[t.uid]; p != ""; p = parentOf[p]` had no visited guard. `ParentUID` comes straight from untrusted `RELATED-TO;RELTYPE=PARENT` data — a reciprocal cycle (hand-edited or foreign `.ics`) makes the walk spin forever, freezing the single-threaded UI event loop. This violates the hard invariant that malformed iCalendar is never fatal. Fixed exactly like the sibling `descendants()` (`edit.go`): a `seen := map[string]bool{...}` guard, bail on revisit.
- **Important**: `selected` was built from the *raw* input targets before filtering, so a child whose only selected ancestor was later filtered out (read-only/missing) was still silently absorbed — dropped from `roots` entirely, uncounted in `skips`, so the confirm's count no longer matched what was actually deleted. Restructured `bulkDeleteRoots` into two passes: first compute `survivors` (the recurring/missing/read-only filters), then build `selected` from survivors only, then run the (now cycle-guarded) absorption check against that survivor-only set.
- **Minor** (included, cheap): `bulkDelete`'s confirm callback now guards the `deleted == 0` case — mirrors `bulkComplete`'s existing `done == 0` guard (no `pushUndo` for a no-op, flash without the undo hint, selection left alone). This can only fire on a race between materializing `roots` and the confirm firing (every uid vanishing in between); deliberately diverges from single-item `deleteWholeObject`'s quirk in favor of parity with `bulkComplete` in the same file.
- **TDD**: `TestBulkDeleteRootsSurvivesParentCycle` (RED — timed out at 3s inside a goroutine-wrapped call, confirming the hang; GREEN — returns immediately, `cycle-c` survives as its own root) and `TestBulkDeleteRootsAbsorbsOnlyIntoSurvivingAncestor` (RED — child silently dropped, `roots` empty; GREEN — child survives as its own root, `read-only` skip count still 1) both added to `internal/ui/bulkops_test.go`, along with a `putTodoWithParent` fixture helper (explicit UID + RELATED-TO parent, needed for the reciprocal-cycle fixture where both ends reference a UID that doesn't exist yet at creation time).
- Verified: `go test ./internal/ui/ -run 'TestBulkDelete' -v` (9/9 pass) and `go test ./internal/ui/... -race` pass; full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`, `gofmt -l` clean).
- Files: `internal/ui/bulkops.go`, `internal/ui/bulkops_test.go`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.4.0: SELECT bulk delete

- **Task 5 of the v1.4.0 SELECT-mode build**: bulk delete (`d` in SELECT), plus `bulkDeleteRoots` — the ancestor-dedupe/filter helper Task 6's bulk yank will also reuse.
- **New in `internal/ui/bulkops.go`**: `a.bulkDeleteRoots(targets)` filters the range down to delete roots — a recurring **event** is skipped (`"recurring"`; bulk deleting a series has no natural single-resource meaning the way a recurring todo's series does), a missing or read-only item is skipped (`"missing"`/`"read-only"`, via the existing `calReadOnly`), and a selected task whose ancestor is also selected is absorbed rather than counted twice — its subtree already travels with the ancestor's delete. `a.bulkDelete()` (`d`) materializes `selRange()`, filters through `bulkDeleteRoots`, expands each surviving root with `a.descendants` (deduped across roots so a shared subtask isn't deleted twice), shows **one** confirm naming the resource count (and the with-subtasks count when it differs), then deletes every resource — mirroring single-item `deleteWholeObject`'s semantics exactly: whole-resource `store.Delete` per UID, no scope picker (a recurring **todo**'s resource is its whole series, the settled "natural meaning"). All-or-nothing: a failed or non-existent write rolls back everything written so far (newest-first, the `moveSubtree`/`bulkComplete` template) and pushes no undo step; full success pushes exactly one compound undo step and exits SELECT.
- Wired the `'d'` case in `handleSelectKey` (`internal/ui/selection.go`) to `a.bulkDelete()`, replacing the stub flash.
- **Read-only coverage note closed** (flagged open after Task 4's review): added `TestBulkDeleteReadOnlySkipped`. The task tree shows one task list at a time, so a single tree range can never mix a read-only and a writable calendar's items — the test instead uses calendar mode, putting one event on a fresh read-only calendar and one on a writable calendar on the same day, selected via a drilled day range; confirms the read-only event survives, the writable one deletes, and the flash counts `"read-only"`.
- **`confirmYes` test helper** (`internal/ui/bulkops_test.go`): no shared helper existed yet for driving `a.confirm`'s Yes button from a test. `a.confirm` sets `a.tv.SetFocus(modal)`, but `tview.Modal.Focus` delegates onward to its internal form, so the application's actual focus lands on the first `*tview.Button` (the affirmative one, since `AddButtons` puts it first) — not the `Modal` itself. `confirmYes` asserts `pageConfirm` is open, type-asserts `a.tv.GetFocus()` to `*tview.Button`, and sends it a `KeyEnter`, which `tview.Modal`'s `SetDoneFunc` turns into the `onYes` callback.
- **Brief deviation**: the brief's sample `TestBulkDeleteSkipsRecurringEvent` called `putRecurringEvent(t, a, testCalID(a), "weekly", now)` (4 args after `a`), but the existing helper (`internal/ui/displaystress_test.go`) takes a 5th `rrule` argument — added `"FREQ=WEEKLY"` rather than guessing an implicit default.
- **TDD**: RED first (`go test ./internal/ui/ -run 'TestBulkDelete' -v` → `undefined: a.bulkDelete`), then GREEN after implementing `bulkops.go` and wiring the key.
- Verified: `go test ./internal/ui/ -run 'TestBulkDelete|TestBulk' -v` and `go test ./internal/ui/... -race` all pass; full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`, `gofmt -l` clean on the touched files).
- Files: `internal/ui/bulkops.go`, `internal/ui/bulkops_test.go`, `internal/ui/selection.go`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.4.0: SELECT bulk complete

- **Task 4 of the v1.4.0 SELECT-mode build**: the first bulk operation and the shared bulk-op helpers.
- **New** `internal/ui/bulkops.go`: `bulkSkip` (a `map[string]int` counting filtered-out items per reason, rendered sorted-deterministic in the flash), `bulkSummary(verb, n, skips)`, `a.calReadOnly(calID)` (guardWrite's read-only test without the flash — shared by the later bulk delete/yank/grab tasks), and `a.bulkComplete()` (Space in SELECT).
- **`bulkComplete`** materializes `selRange()`, then walks it in **reverse visible order** (children before parents), Locating each target fresh immediately before acting on it: events, missing items, read-only calendars, already-done tasks, and folders with incomplete children are skipped and counted; a plain task completes via `model.SetTodoCompleted`, a recurring todo advances one occurrence via `model.AdvanceRecurringTodo` (single-item Space semantics, applied per item). Processing one item fully (including its write) before moving to the next is what makes the folder+last-child case work in one pass — the child's completion lands in the store before the folder's `hasIncompleteChildren` check runs. All-or-nothing: any write failure rolls back the op's own writes (newest-first, `moveSubtree`'s template) and pushes no undo step; full success pushes exactly one compound undo step and exits SELECT.
- Wired the `' '` case in `handleSelectKey` (`internal/ui/selection.go`) to `a.bulkComplete()`, replacing the stub flash.
- **`putRecurringTodo` deviation**: the brief's sample test called a 4-arg `putRecurringTodo(t, a, calID, summary, due)` (implied `FREQ=DAILY`), but `internal/ui/recur_edit_test.go` already has a 5-arg `putRecurringTodo(t, a, calID, summary, due, rrule)` from earlier work. Reused the existing helper with `rrule="FREQ=DAILY"` rather than adding a same-named, differently-shaped duplicate.
- **Stale-rollback test deviation** (`TestBulkCompleteStaleRollsBack`): the brief's literal test (an external `store.Put` on task A, done entirely *before* calling `bulkComplete()`) cannot trigger genuine mid-batch staleness under this (or any correct) implementation — `bulkComplete` re-Locates each item immediately before writing it, so a mutation that lands before the whole call is already the "current" state by the time it's read; there is no window for a version mismatch in a single synchronous call. Ran the literal test to confirm: it fails outright (both items complete, no rollback), not "passes trivially". Adapted the test to trigger the identical rollback code path (`PutIfUnchanged`/the write returning an error, not the CAS itself) via the codebase's own established deterministic-write-failure idiom — planting a directory at the exact path the store is about to rename a file onto (`TestCommitSplitRollsBackMasterOnFutureWriteFailure`'s mechanism) — using a bespoke disk-backed store (mirroring that test's setup) rather than `newRootedTestApp`'s opaque temp dir, so the exact resource path is known.
- **Self-review fix**: the recurring-todo branch unconditionally added every completed item to `sticky` (for `stickyDone`) regardless of whether `AdvanceRecurringTodo` actually finished the series; a mid-series advance leaves the todo incomplete, so pinning it sticky-visible was harmless bookkeeping noise (render's visibility filter already short-circuits on `!Completed()`) but misleading. Now only adds to `sticky` when the write actually completed the item (plain task, or a recurring series that ran out) — mirrors `advanceRecurringTodo`'s single-item `done` gating exactly.
- **TDD**: RED first (`go test ./internal/ui/ -run 'TestBulkComplete' -v` → `undefined: a.bulkComplete`), then GREEN after implementing `bulkops.go` and wiring the key.
- Verified: `go test ./internal/ui/ -run 'TestBulkComplete|TestSelect|TestRecurringTodo' -v` and `go test ./internal/ui/... -race -run 'TestBulkComplete|TestSelect'` all pass; full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`, `gofmt -l` clean on the touched files).

## 2026-07-23 — Bugfix: "Selection cleared" flash was clobbered by updateStatus

- **Important** (reviewer-found on Task 3): `syncSelectionVisuals`'s anchor-vanished branch called `a.flash("Selection cleared — the items changed")` then fell through to the trailing unconditional `a.updateStatus()` — both write `statusLeft` synchronously, so the ordinary status text overwrote the flash in the same call and the user never saw it. The brief anticipated exactly this failure mode but the landed code didn't apply the fix.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/selection.go`): restructured `syncSelectionVisuals` around a local `cleared` flag — the anchor-vanished branch now only sets state and `cleared = true`; the grid-field sync, `syncTreeSelection`, and `updateStatus` run unconditionally as before; the flash moved to the end of the function, gated on `cleared`, so it's the last write to `statusLeft` on the clearing path. Behavior otherwise identical.
- **TDD**: extended `TestTreeRangeAnchorVanished` (`internal/ui/selection_test.go`) to assert `a.statusLeft.GetText(true)` contains "Selection cleared" after the vanish path runs. Confirmed RED first (`statusLeft` held the ordinary "Tasks · ..." status text, no mention of the flash), then GREEN after the fix.
- **Minor** (same review pass): the new `select-tasks` displaystress state (Task 3) skipped the `buildTree()`/`expandAllNodes` steps the pre-existing `"tasks"` state performs, so the SELECT-mode tree stress ran on a shallow, non-expanded tree. Mirrored the `"tasks"` state's setup in `select-tasks` (`internal/ui/displaystress_test.go`) so the range highlighting is stressed against the same deep/wide fixture.
- Verified: `go test ./internal/ui/ -run 'TestTreeRangeAnchorVanished|TestSelect|TestDisplayStress' -v` all pass; full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`, `gofmt -l` clean on the touched files).

## 2026-07-23 — v1.4.0: SELECT range visuals

- **Task 3 of the v1.4.0 SELECT-mode build**: wired the range derived in Task 2 (`selRange`/`itemIndex`) into the three views that display it.
- **Shared helper**: `dayInRange(anchor, cursor, day)` in `internal/ui/selection.go` — whether a day falls inside `[anchor, cursor]` (either order); a zero anchor means no active range.
- **Tree**: `a.syncTreeSelection()` walks the visible tree rows and sets `TreeNode.SetTextStyle` to the theme-adaptive `selectionStyle` for every row inside the range, `tcell.StyleDefault` otherwise — restoring every row on exit. Event-driven only (never a draw path), per the tview-freeze guardrail.
- **`syncSelectionVisuals`** is now a full replacement: after the existing anchor-validation/flash, it pushes plain `selDayAnchor`/`selAnchorUID`/`selAnchorOcc` fields into both `calendarView` and `timeGridView` (cleared first, set only for the active context), calls `syncTreeSelection`, then `updateStatus`. The grids derive the other end of the range from their own `selected`/`eventIndex` at draw time — no app-lock calls from any `Draw` path.
- **Month grid** (`calendarview.go`): a day inside a day-range gets an accent-colored outline box (the cursor day keeps its existing focused-style box, so the two ends stay visually distinct); a drilled day's items between the anchor and the cursor draw reverse-video, with the cursor item itself bold+underlined so it doesn't read as just another range row.
- **Time grid** (`timegridview.go`): the day header reverses every in-range day, with the cursor day also underlined; a drilled item-range highlights matching event blocks and task markers the same way, via a shared `inSelRange` closure. The collapsed all-day "+N" band keeps its existing cursor-only highlight (documented limitation — collapse already hides individual membership).
- **`app.go`**: the tree's `SetChangedFunc`, the month/time-grid `onSelectEvent` closures, and the shared `onCalDay` day-move handler now call `a.syncSelectionVisuals()` when `a.selecting`, so cursor motion restyles the range live.
- **Test-dimension deviation from the brief**: `TestDrilledRangeMarksItems` originally used an 84×30 pane (matching the brief). At that geometry the month grid's fixed 6-row layout gives a day cell only one content line; combined with the fixture's pre-existing 2026-07-05 "Project meeting" event (3 items total that day), the cell's overflow logic collapses everything to a single "+3 more" line — no item is ever drawn individually, regardless of highlighting logic. Bumped to 84×48 (verified minimum is 84×40; picked 48 for headroom) with a comment explaining why; confirmed by a throwaway probe that the implementation is correct once the cell is tall enough (reversed-cell count matched exactly `len("eventone")+len("eventtwo")`).
- **`displaystress_test.go`**: extended `TestDisplayStress` with five `select-*` states (tree, month day-range, week day-range, month-drilled, day-drilled) that press `V` from each existing state and `spray` the cursor before drawing across the full `stressGeoms` matrix — the same watchdog/panic-recover harness, now covering the new SELECT draw branches.
- Full gate green: `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`, `gofmt -l` clean (pre-existing unrelated `gofmt` findings in `internal/model` and `vendor/` untouched).
- Files: `internal/ui/selection.go`, `internal/ui/calendarview.go`, `internal/ui/timegridview.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/displaystress_test.go`; new `internal/ui/selectionvisuals_test.go`.

## 2026-07-23 — Tests: SELECT range boundary coverage (days/drill reversed, single, cap)

- **Coverage gap** (reviewer-found on Task 2's own tests): `treeRange` had reversed-cursor and single-item boundary cases (`TestTreeRange`), but `daysRange`/`drillRange` only had a forward-only happy-path case each — no reversed direction, no single-item/single-day, and no test of the `maxSelectDays` cap.
- **Closed** (`internal/ui/selection_test.go`, no production code change — these are new tests over existing, already-correct logic): `TestDaysRangeReversed` (cursor day before the anchor selects the same interval as forward), `TestDaysRangeSingleDay` (cursor on the anchor day selects just that day), `TestDaysRangeCapsAtMaxSelectDays` (a cursor 400 days out is capped at `maxSelectDays`; a fixture event beyond the cap is asserted absent, one within range asserted present, and every returned target's `occStart` is asserted before the cap cutoff), `TestDrillRangeReversed` and `TestDrillRangeSingle` (the same two boundary shapes for the drilled-day item list).
- All five passed on first run (no RED phase possible — the logic under test was already correct; these close a boundary-testing gap in the test suite itself, not a bug).
- Full gate green: `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`, `gofmt -l` clean.
- Also fixed a Minor from the same review pass: the previous log entry's "(reviewer-found on Task 2)" was inaccurate (the bug was caught in Task 2's own self-review, not by an external reviewer) — corrected to "(found in Task 2 self-review)", entry otherwise unchanged.
- Files: `internal/ui/selection_test.go`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — Bugfix: V on an empty calendar day exited SELECT immediately

- **Bug** (found in Task 2 self-review): `daysRange()` returned a bare `nil` both when the anchor was genuinely unresolvable *and* when the selected date interval simply materialized no items. `syncSelectionVisuals` treats any `nil` range as "anchor vanished" and exits SELECT — but a date anchor (`selAnchorDay`) can never vanish the way a tree UID or drilled item can, so an empty day is a *valid* empty selection. The bug: pressing `V` on an un-drilled calendar day with no events/due tasks flipped `a.selecting` back off inside the same `enterSelect()` call, before the user could extend the range (`f`/`b`) onto a day that does have items.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/selection.go`): `daysRange()` still returns `nil` for its two genuine-anchor-loss guards (no `calGrid`, `selAnchorDay.IsZero()`), but now initializes the accumulator as `out := []editTarget{}` instead of `var out []editTarget`, so an interval with no matching items returns a non-nil empty slice — distinguishable from a lost anchor. `treeRange`/`drillRange` are untouched; their `nil` still means a genuinely lost anchor (deleted UID, cursor index out of range).
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `TestDaysRangeEmptyDayStaysSelected` (`internal/ui/selection_test.go`) enters SELECT in calendar mode on a day with no items and asserts `a.selecting` stays true and `selRange()` returns a non-nil empty slice; RED before the fix (`a.selecting` was false), GREEN after. Full gate re-run clean (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`).
- Files: `internal/ui/selection.go`, `internal/ui/selection_test.go`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.4.0: SELECT range derivation

- Task 2 of the v1.4.0 SELECT-mode feature: `a.selRange() []editTarget` materializes the anchor→cursor range for each of the three SELECT contexts, and `syncSelectionVisuals` gains an anchor-validation guard so a range that can no longer be derived exits SELECT instead of acting on a guess.
- `internal/ui/selection.go`: `treeRange()` slices the visible tree rows (`visibleTreeNodes`) between the anchor UID and the cursor node, either direction, inclusive. `daysRange()` walks the selected date interval day-by-day (`a.dayItems`), deduping a multi-day event to one target and capping the span at the new `maxSelectDays = 366` so `f`/`b` can't build a multi-year materialization that stalls the UI. `drillRange()` slices the drilled day's item list between the anchor (found by the new `itemIndex` helper, matching on UID + occurrence start) and the cursor index. `selRange()` dispatches on `selContext()`; nil means the anchor is unresolvable (deleted remotely, or — for a day range — no items in the interval) and every caller (`syncSelectionVisuals`) treats nil as "exit SELECT", never "empty result to act on".
- `syncSelectionVisuals` (`selection.go`) now validates: `a.selecting && a.selRange() == nil` clears every anchor field, updates the status line, and flashes "Selection cleared — the items changed" instead of silently doing nothing. Wired as the last line of `refresh(selUID)` (`edit.go`) so a background sync's refresh is what actually catches a remotely-deleted anchor.
- `updateStatus` (`render.go`) prefixes the status line with `"N selected · "` while selecting, `N = len(a.selRange())`.
- **TDD**: `internal/ui/selection_test.go` extended — `TestTreeRange` (forward/reversed/single-item ranges over a 5-task tree), `TestTreeRangeAnchorVanished` (a store-level delete + `refresh` exits SELECT), `TestDaysRange` (a 3-day range with a spanning event deduped to one target), `TestDrillRange` (drilled-day anchor→cursor slice), and `TestSelectRangeSyncRace` (500 `selRange()` calls against a goroutine repeatedly deleting/recreating one resource via raw store calls, run under `-race` — never panics, never returns a target for the mid-deletion resource). RED confirmed (`undefined: a.selRange`) before implementation, GREEN after; race detector clean.
- Full gate green: `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`, `gofmt -l` clean.
- Files: `internal/ui/selection.go`, `internal/ui/selection_test.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/render.go`.

## 2026-07-23 — Bugfix: modified arrow keys leaked through SELECT key layer

- **Bug** (reviewer-found on Task 1): `handleSelectKey`'s arrow-key case matched on `ev.Key()` alone, so a modified arrow — Ctrl+Left/Ctrl+Right — passed through as "motion" while selecting. `globalKeys` then fell past the vim-count/`motionArrow` path (no count, not a letter) onto the pre-existing Ctrl-gated resize handlers, calling `a.resizeLeft(...)` — mutating the pane layout and persisting state to disk mid-select, contradicting SELECT's swallow-everything contract.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/selection.go`): the arrow/Home/End case in `handleSelectKey` now passes the event through only when `ev.Modifiers() == tcell.ModNone`; anything with a modifier falls to the swallow-everything default. Also tightened the `resolvePrefix` gate comment (`internal/ui/keys.go`) — only the `g` prefix reaches it mid-select (`handleSelectKey` swallows `i`/`s`/`z` first), not all four prefixes as previously worded.
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `TestSelectSwallowsModifiedArrows` (`internal/ui/selection_test.go`) feeds a Ctrl-modified `KeyLeft`/`KeyRight` through `a.globalKeys` while selecting and asserts `a.leftWidth` is unchanged and SELECT stays active; RED before the `ModNone` gate, green after. Full gate re-run clean.
- Files: `internal/ui/selection.go`, `internal/ui/selection_test.go`, `internal/ui/keys.go`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.4.0: SELECT mode core (state, badge, key layer)

- Task 1 of the v1.4.0 SELECT-mode feature: the multi-select layer's core plumbing, with no bulk operations wired yet (later tasks add range derivation, visuals, and the ops themselves).
- New `internal/ui/selection.go`: `selecting`/`selAnchorUID`/`selAnchorOcc`/`selAnchorDay` app fields (`app.go`); `selContext()` derives which of `selTree`/`selDays`/`selDrill`/`selNone` the current view offers (never stored, so a context-switch key can't desync it from what's on screen); `enterSelect()` (`V`) anchors on the tree's current UID, the un-drilled calendar's selected day, or the drilled item, and refuses (flash) from the agenda pane or an empty context; `exitSelect()` clears the anchors without touching the underlying view state (a drilled day, the tree cursor), so `Esc` backs out exactly one mode level; `handleSelectKey` is the semi-modal key layer — motion (`hjkl`/arrows/`gg`/counts) passes through to extend the range, the bulk-op keys (`Space`/`d`/`y`/`Y`/`m`) are stubbed with a flash for later tasks, everything else is swallowed.
- Wired in: `globalKeys` (`app.go`) routes through `handleSelectKey` before the normal dispatch, falling through only for unhandled motion; the `V` rune binding calls `enterSelect()`. `interactionMode()`/`drawModeIndicator`/`updateStatus` (`render.go`) add the `modeSelect` ("SELECT") badge/hints — placed so a nested GRAB still wins the badge. `resolvePrefix` (`keys.go`) blocks every chord continuation except `gg` while selecting (`gt`/`gd`/`i…`/`s…`/`z…` would jump context or mutate under an active range). `mouseCapture` (`mouse.go`) goes inert while selecting, matching grab/resize.
- **TDD**: `internal/ui/selection_test.go` (new) — entry gate per context (tree/un-drilled calendar/drilled day accept, agenda refuses), the SELECT badge (incl. nested-GRAB-wins), the key layer (motion passes, context/data keys inert, Esc/V exit), the prefix gate (`gg` allowed, `gt` blocked), and Esc-from-SELECT landing back in DRILL (not day navigation) rather than unwinding two levels at once. `internal/ui/mode_test.go` extended with SELECT badge cases (`TestInteractionMode`, `TestModeIndicatorRenders`).
- Full gate green: `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`; `TestDisplayStress`/`TestModeIndicatorNoLiveDeadlock` re-run clean (no regression in the freeze-trap suites).
- Files: `internal/ui/selection.go` (new), `internal/ui/selection_test.go` (new), `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/keys.go`, `internal/ui/mouse.go`, `internal/ui/mode_test.go`.

## 2026-07-24 — v1.3.0 released; post-release verification + doc currency

- **v1.3.0 released** (owner merged `ai-workspace` → `main` and tagged `v1.3.0` at `1f8da57`). Verified it landed cleanly: the origin tag points at `1f8da57` (includes the grab-reanchor fix); CI green on the tag and `main`; the Release workflow completed and attached all **8** assets (darwin amd64/arm64, linux amd64/arm64/armv6/armv7, windows amd64, `sha256sums.txt`); `linux_amd64` checksum verified against `sha256sums.txt` and the binary smoke-tested reporting `LazyPlanner v1.3.0`.
- Doc currency (this cleanup): `main.md` Current State flipped to "v1.0.0–v1.3.0 released; next feature is v1.4.0 SELECT mode (not started)"; the v1.3.0 Build Plan header/Status flipped from "implemented" to "released 2026-07-24" with the asset/checksum verification note. `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md` grab-mode row records the post-v1.3.0 reanchor fix + guardrail.
- **Note for a future maintenance pass** (v1.5.0): the Release workflow logs a Node.js 20 deprecation warning — `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-go@v5`, `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` are force-run on Node 24; non-blocking, bump the action versions eventually.
- No code change.
- Files: `main.md`, `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — Bugfix: grab-all day-move made recurring events with a day-pinning rule disappear

- **Bug** (owner-reported): grabbing a recurring event at scope *all* and moving the day (`h`/`l`) made it vanish from the calendar. **Root cause** (systematic-debugging, verified with a UI repro): the day-move shifts `DTSTART` but `EditEvent` preserves the RRULE, so a day-pinning `BY*` (weekly `BYDAY`, monthly nth-weekday — every v1.3.0 preset carries one) kept firing on the *old* day; the moved `DTSTART` fell outside its own set (anchor occurrence dropped) and the UI then navigated to the moved day, which had no occurrence → "disappeared". Plain `FREQ=WEEKLY` (no `BY*`) already worked, which is why it was intermittent.
- **Fix**: `model.ReanchoredRecurrence(master, newStart)` (`internal/model/recur_edit.go`) derives the rule to write on a whole-series day-move — weekly weekday sets shift as a whole (Mon,Thu → Tue,Fri), monthly nth-weekday re-derives from the new date; daily/plain-weekly/monthly-by-day/yearly need no rewrite (no day-pinning `BY*`, `DTSTART` re-anchors them); a rule outside the editable vocabulary (*Custom rule (kept)*) **blocks** the day-move with a hint (owner-chosen) rather than risk corruption. Wired into grab's `h`/`l` branch for scope all/future (`internal/ui/grab.go`); scope *this occurrence* is unaffected (it writes a per-instance override, not the master).
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `internal/model/reanchor_test.go` (per-frequency re-anchor + block + no-op table) and `internal/ui/grab_recur_reanchor_test.go` (the promoted repro: a weekly-BYDAY grab-all +1 day now lands the whole series on the new weekday and stays visible; plain-weekly unregressed). Both RED before, green after.
- **Guardrail** (`CLAUDE.md`): added "moving a recurring item's anchor must keep the rule consistent with it — never leave `DTSTART` contradicting its own `BY*`" (the same invariant the v1.3.0 Custom sub-form enforces). Docs: `main.md` grab-mode section describes the re-anchoring + kept-rule block.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); grab suite clean.
- Files: `internal/model/recur_edit.go`, `internal/model/reanchor_test.go` (new), `internal/ui/grab.go`, `internal/ui/grab_recur_reanchor_test.go` (new), `main.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.3.0: Custom repeat sub-form redesign (dynamic fields + weekday strip)

- Reworked the Custom… repeat sub-form (`internal/ui/recurcustom.go`) from a static 13-field wall into a dynamic form that shows only the fields relevant to the current selection: Every, Unit, Ends always; the weekday strip only for weeks; "Monthly by" only for months; Until/Count only for the matching Ends choice. Unit/Ends changes re-lay-out the form live (`layoutCustomRepeat`, via `caretForm.clearItems`/`addExisting`), preserving values in fields that stay visible. Modal height 22→12.
- New `weekdayStrip` widget (`internal/ui/weekdaystrip.go`) — a single-row `tview.FormItem` replacing the 7 weekday checkboxes: drilled into via the app-wide NORMAL/DRILL model (Enter drills; `←`/`→` or `h`/`l` move the day cursor; Space toggles; Esc leaves), selected days reverse-video via `selectionStyle`, the focused cell underlined in the accent color.
- caretForm gained `newFormDropDown` (centralizes the dropdown `selectionStyle` guardrail), `clearItems`/`addExisting` (relayout primitives), `isDrillable` (auto-drill includes the strip), and a `*weekdayStrip` case in `actNormal` + the Draw gutter.
- **Repro-first**: `weekdaystrip_test.go` (seed/read, cursor+toggle, reverse-video legibility, draw-stress), `formnav_test.go` (strip drills+toggles in a caretForm; clearItems/addExisting), `recurcustom_test.go` (relayout hides/shows the right fields + preserves values; daily is 3 fields; relaid-out draw-stress). Existing read/validation tests updated to the strip API.
- Docs rippled: `main.md` (item → shipped, both pre-release items now done), `log.md`.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`).
- Files: `internal/ui/weekdaystrip.go`, `internal/ui/weekdaystrip_test.go`, `internal/ui/forms.go`, `internal/ui/formnav_test.go`, `internal/ui/recurcustom.go`, `internal/ui/recurcustom_test.go`, `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.3.0: rigorous type-to-confirm for collection deletes

- Collection deletes (calendar/list, `d` on the focused Calendars/Tasks pane) are not undoable, so they no longer use the one-button confirm. A new type-to-confirm dialog (`promptDeleteCollection`, `internal/ui/calendar.go`) requires typing the collection's exact name — trim + case-sensitive (`collectionDeleteNameMatches`) — before **Delete** fires; a mismatch flashes "Name doesn't match" and keeps the dialog open. Item deletes (undoable) keep the ordinary confirm.
- Built on the shared `caretForm` (inherits the popup chrome, focus-stack, and NORMAL/DRILL nav); the warning lives in the title (`⚠ Delete <noun> "<name>" (N item(s)) — cannot be undone`) since `openModal` type-asserts a `*caretForm` and can't wrap a separate text line.
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `TestCollectionDeleteNameMatches` (match table) and `TestCollectionDeleteRequiresTypedName` (wrong name → nothing deleted, dialog stays open; correct whitespace-padded name → deleted, modal closed) — both RED before, green after.
- Docs rippled: `main.md` (item moved to shipped + collection-delete prose), `README.md` (delete row + prose), `:help`.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`).
- Files: `internal/ui/calendar.go`, `internal/ui/calendar_test.go`, `internal/ui/help.go`, `main.md`, `README.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — Docs: reinstate SELECT as v1.4.0, polish to v1.5.0; de-creep Current State

- Owner reversed the prior day's SELECT-mode decision (main.md, in place): SELECT is too big to drop.
  - **v1.4.0 is SELECT mode again** — the `### v1.4.0` section rewritten from "polishing & auditing" back to the SELECT-mode scope (multi-select layer, mode-composition core built on `interactionMode`, no parallel enum), moved up from the Future-versions deferred list.
  - **v1.5.0 is now polishing & auditing** — new `### v1.5.0` section carrying the consolidation/maintenance scope formerly at v1.4.0.
  - Future-versions intro updated (feature line now closes at v1.4.0; polish is v1.5.0); SELECT removed from the deferred-ideas list.
- **De-creep the Current State section**: it had been appended to rather than updated in place, narrating each release's implement/verify/release dates. Rewritten tight — states only what's current (v1.0.0–v1.2.0 released, v1.3.0 in progress with two UI items left, v1.4.0 SELECT / v1.5.0 polish ahead). Per-version release history stays in the Build Plan subsections, where it belongs.
- No code change.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — Docs: roadmap restructure — fold two items into v1.3.0, scrap SELECT, re-slot v1.4.0

- Owner-directed roadmap change (main.md, in place):
  - The two UI items noted earlier (custom-recurrence form redesign; rigorous irreversible-delete confirm) are now **v1.3.0 scope** — moved out of the Future-versions backlog into a **"Planned before release"** group under v1.3.0's Post-Build Incremental Changes. v1.3.0 Status + Current State updated to say two UI items remain before release.
  - **SELECT mode scrapped as v1.4.0** — the `### v1.4.0 — SELECT mode (planned)` section removed; the idea is preserved, **deferred**, as a candidate under Future versions ("a sound idea, out of time").
  - **v1.4.0 re-slotted to "polishing & auditing"** (the phase formerly mentally at v1.5.0): a consolidation/maintenance phase, not a new feature; scoped in detail when it begins. Future-versions intro now states the feature line closes at v1.3.0.
- No code change.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — Docs: record next-up UI backlog items

- Added two owner-noted UI items to `main.md`'s Future-versions "Known candidates awaiting a version" list (backlog, undesigned): **Custom-recurrence form redesign** (make the Custom… sub-form less cumbersome) and **rigorous confirm for irreversible deletes** (collection delete isn't undoable — verified `deleteCollection` uses the ordinary confirm and pushes no undo op).
- No code change; captured for a future planning pass (each becomes a `### v1.x.0` subsection when picked up).
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — Bugfix: arrow keys dead in an open form dropdown

- After opening a dropdown in a form, `↑`/`↓` (and Enter) didn't steer the list. **Root cause**: `DropDown.HasFocus()` forwards to its open list, so the `caretForm` stays in the focus chain and its `navKey` input capture runs *ahead* of the open list — in NORMAL it swallowed `↓`/`↑` as field navigation, so the arrows never reached the list.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/forms.go`): `navKey` now checks `focusedDropDown().IsOpen()` up front and returns the event unhandled while a dropdown is open, so the native list owns `↑`/`↓`/`Enter`/`Esc` and type-ahead until it closes.
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `TestFormOpenDropdownReceivesArrowKeys` (`internal/ui/formnav_test.go`) — open a dropdown, `↓` then `Enter`, assert option 1 is selected. RED (selected 0 — arrows swallowed) before, green after.
- Full gate green; `go test -race ./internal/ui/` clean.
- Files: `internal/ui/forms.go`, `internal/ui/formnav_test.go`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — Feature: DRILL-mode form navigation

- Implemented the app-wide NORMAL/DRILL input model for the full-screen form dialogs, once in the shared `caretForm` so all four forms (event, task, calendar, Custom repeat) inherit it — replacing tview's Tab-only field movement.
- **NORMAL** (forms open here): `j`/`k`/`↑`/`↓` step fields + Save/Cancel buttons, `h`/`l` move between buttons, `g`/`G` jump to first field / last element, `Enter` acts on the focused element (drill a text field, open a dropdown, toggle+advance a checkbox, activate a button), `Esc` cancels, other keys inert. `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` remain advance/previous aliases.
- **DRILL**: keys reach the focused text field (so `hjkl` are letters, `←`/`→` move the cursor); `Enter` commits and advances, **auto-drilling** the next text field but stopping in NORMAL on a dropdown/checkbox/button; `Esc` returns to NORMAL keeping the value.
- **Implementation** (`internal/ui/forms.go`): a form-level `SetInputCapture` (`navKey`→`normalKey`/`drillKey`) plus a `drilled` flag. The capture runs before tview's item delegation (returning `nil` swallows, returning the event passes it through). Dropdowns delegate to tview's native open list (arrow-key nav + type-ahead, `Enter` selects, `Esc` aborts) — `j`/`k` can't drive the open list because tview reinstalls its own capture on it each open; documented in `main.md`.
- **App-focus sync**: nav routes focus moves through the Application's setter (`caretForm.appFocus`, wired in `openModal`) so `a.focus`/`GetFocus()` track the leaf item — otherwise a nested modal (e.g. the calendar form's Pick color…) would `captureFocus` a stale primitive and restore focus wrong on close (the softlock-adjacent focus class). Falls back to the form-internal `SetFocus` in bare-widget tests.
- **Mode badge**: `interactionMode` now reports the form's NORMAL/DRILL when a modal is open (via `a.formDrill`, set by `caretForm.onDrill`), taking precedence over a calendar drill left standing behind the form; reset on modal close.
- **Repro-first tests** (`internal/ui/formnav_test.go`, 12 cases): open-in-NORMAL + no-typing, Enter-drills-then-types (hjkl as letters), Esc DRILL→NORMAL keeps value, NORMAL Esc cancels, Enter commit+auto-drill next text field, stop-NORMAL on non-text, checkbox toggle+advance, `g`/`G`, `h`/`l` button-only + clamp, Enter activates a button, Tab/Backtab aliases, app-focus stays in sync, and the DRILL mode-badge surface. All RED before, green after.
- Docs rippled in the same increment: `main.md` (Post-Build subsection now describes the shipped behavior incl. the dropdown arrow-key note), `README.md` (mode-badge meaning + a NORMAL/DRILL form-navigation concept sentence), `:help` (new "Forms (full dialogs)" section + badge line).
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`); `go test -race ./internal/ui/` clean.
- Files: `internal/ui/forms.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/help.go`, `internal/ui/formnav_test.go`, `main.md`, `README.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — Docs: v1.3.0 "Post-Build Incremental Changes" section in main.md

- Added a `#### Post-Build Incremental Changes` subsection under the v1.3.0 Build Plan (`main.md`), recording behavior refinements made after the six-step build so the spec stays the source of truth for what the program does.
- **Unified dialog chrome** — documents the confirmation/picker standardization (`styleModal`, accent border + contextual titles, no contrast band) and theme-adaptive selection everywhere incl. dropdowns.
- **DRILL-mode form navigation** — documents the just-settled design (NORMAL/DRILL modal input layer in `caretForm`: hjkl/g/G/Enter/Esc semantics, auto-drill advance, dropdown/checkbox rules, Tab aliases, interactionMode badge). Marked "design settled 2026-07-23" — implementation follows.
- No code change.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — Bugfix: confirmation-modal border highlight band

- The confirmation/picker modals showed a highlighted (blue) band around the border. **Root cause**: `tview.Modal`'s constructor sets its embedded `Box` background to `Styles.ContrastBackgroundColor`, but `Modal.SetBackgroundColor` resets only the frame/form — never the Box. So the box fill and the border's background stayed the contrast color (a latent issue predating the chrome work, made visible by the new accent border).
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/forms.go`): `styleModal` now also calls `m.Box.SetBackgroundColor(tcell.ColorDefault)`, so the border sits on the unified terminal-default background with no band.
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `TestConfirmModalHasNoContrastHighlight` (`internal/ui/modalstyle_test.go`) — asserts no drawn cell uses `Styles.ContrastBackgroundColor`. RED (blue cells present) before, green after.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`).
- Files: `internal/ui/forms.go`, `internal/ui/modalstyle_test.go`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — UI polish: standardize confirmation-dialog chrome

- Confirmation/picker dialogs (`tview.Modal`) looked plainer than the forms and other popups — they lacked the accent rounded border and had no title. Standardized them to match (owner-approved: contextual title per dialog, keep tview.Modal's auto-sizing).
- **Shared helper** `styleModal(m *tview.Modal, title string)` (`internal/ui/forms.go`) — the modal twin of `stylePopup`: terminal-default background/text, reverse-video active button, **accent border + accent title**. Single source of truth; all five modal sites route through it (previously each repeated the 5-line style block, none set the border/title).
- **Contextual titles**: `confirm`/`confirmOK` (`edit.go`) gained a leading `title` param. Item delete → ` Delete task ` / ` Delete event ` (from `loc`); calendar/list delete (`calendar.go`) → ` Delete calendar ` / ` Delete list ` (mode-aware); detach task occurrence (`recur_edit.go`) → ` Detach occurrence `; recurring scope picker → ` Recurring event ` / ` Recurring task ` (body simplified to "Apply change to:"); conflict resolve (`conflicts.go`) → ` Resolve conflict `.
- Behavior unchanged (sizing, buttons, keys); chrome-only. Removed the now-unused `tcell` import from `recur_edit.go`.
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `internal/ui/modalstyle_test.go` (new) — `TestConfirmModalHasAccentChrome` asserts a styled modal has its title and renders an accent-colored border cell. RED (undefined `styleModal`) before, green after.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`).
- Files: `internal/ui/forms.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/calendar.go`, `internal/ui/recur_edit.go`, `internal/ui/conflicts.go`, `internal/ui/modalstyle_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.3.0 bugfixes: nested-modal focus softlock + dropdown selection legibility

- Two bugs found in the just-built recurrence UI, fixed repro-first (systematic-debugging → failing test → root-cause fix → guardrail).
- **Softlock (bug 1)**: saving/closing the Custom… repeat sub-form returned focus to the drilled calendar behind the still-open item form, which then couldn't be reached or closed. **Root cause**: `captureFocus` (`internal/ui/edit.go`) recorded the calendar drill state for *every* modal while `mode == modeCalendar`, including a nested one — so `restoreFocus` re-drilled the calendar and focused the grid past the outer form. **Fix**: capture the drill state only when no modal is already open (`&& !a.modalOpen()`); a nested modal's captured focus now points at the outer modal.
- **Dropdown legibility (bug 2)**: the recurrence dropdowns rendered the selected row white-on-white — the same class already fixed for `tview.List`, reappearing for `tview.DropDown` (whose embedded list wasn't styled). **Fix**: `caretForm.addDropDown` (`internal/ui/forms.go`) now calls `SetListStyles(tcell.StyleDefault, selectionStyle)`, so every form dropdown (priority, Repeat, the Custom sub-form's Unit/Monthly-by/Ends) is legible.
- **Guardrail (`CLAUDE.md`)**: the "every List sets `selectionStyle`" bullet broadened to include `DropDown`s via `SetListStyles` (class has now reappeared twice); added a new bullet — a modal nested over another modal must not restore focus to the calendar (`captureFocus` + `!modalOpen()`).
- **Repro-first**: `internal/ui/recurbugfix_test.go` (new) — `TestNestedModalOverDrilledCalendarKeepsFormFocus` (reproduced the softlock: focus escaped to `*ui.calendarView`) and `TestDropDownSelectionIsLegible` (open-dropdown selected row must be reverse-video). Both RED before, green after.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`).
- Files: `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/forms.go`, `internal/ui/recurbugfix_test.go` (new), `CLAUDE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.3.0 step 6: docs ripple — v1.3.0 build complete

- Final v1.3.0 build step — no code, docs brought current with the shipped Repeat field.
- **main.md**: the Creation section's "edits every field **except the recurrence rule**" sentence **rewritten in place** to describe the Repeat dropdown (None / anchor-derived presets / Custom… sub-form), the "Custom rule (kept)" preservation + rewrite-only-when-changed rule, and the per-scope behavior (All rewrites the master keeping EXDATEs / dropping orphaned overrides; this & future gives the split its rule; this-occurrence hides the field; Repeat→None clears). Current State flipped to "v1.3.0 implemented 2026-07-23, awaiting release; v1.4.0 SELECT next". The v1.3.0 Build Plan header flipped from "(planned)" to "(implemented 2026-07-23)" with a Status line.
- **`:help`** (`internal/ui/help.go`): added a **Repeat (full form)** row to Edit & organize.
- **README.md**: the quick-add `repeat` bullet now points at the full form for richer rules; the **Recurring items** section gained a lead paragraph describing the Repeat field (presets + Custom… + kept-rule preservation).
- **v1.3.0 is feature-complete**: all six build steps implemented repro-first with green full gates, verified headlessly (model round-trip + unrepresentable catalogue, rewrite primitives, extended fuzz, UI seeding/read/sub-form + display-stress + focus-stack). Awaiting the owner's release/tag.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`).
- Files: `main.md`, `internal/ui/help.go`, `README.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.3.0 step 5: Custom… recurrence sub-form (nested modal)

- Implemented the fifth v1.3.0 build step — the **Custom… sub-form**, a nested modal over the item form (the color-picker focus-stack precedent) that builds an arbitrary in-vocabulary rule.
- **Sub-form** (`internal/ui/recurcustom.go`): `Every [N]` + unit dropdown, Mon–Su weekday checkboxes, a **Monthly by** dropdown whose options are **derived from the anchor date** (`on day N` / `on the <nth> <weekday>` / `on the last <weekday>` — so a monthly rule can't contradict its start, Google parity), and an **Ends** dropdown (Never / On date / After N times) with date + count inputs. Static form — inputs irrelevant to the chosen frequency are ignored at read. Validation: interval ≥ 1, until parses, count ≥ 1.
- **Trigger + write-back** (`wireRepeatCustom`): selecting the Repeat dropdown's `Custom…` entry opens the sub-form seeded from the current selection (`SeedSpec`); OK writes the humanized spec back via `RepeatChoices.SetCustom` (a `repeatCustomSet` entry that `Resolve` treats as a rewrite — unless it equals the untouched seeded rule) and selects it; Cancel restores the prior selection. Guarded against the `SetCurrentOption`→callback re-entry.
- **Model support** (`internal/model/recurfield.go`): `repeatCustomSet` kind, `SetCustom` (replaces any prior custom entry, no unbounded growth), `SeedSpec`.
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `internal/model/recurfield_test.go` extended (SetCustom rewrite/replace/unchanged, SeedSpec). `internal/ui/recurcustom_test.go` (new) — `monthlyOptions` derivation, `readCustomRecur` per frequency + end condition, validation rejects, **display-stress** across 1×1→400×150, and a **focus-stack** nest/unwind test.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`).
- Files: `internal/ui/recurcustom.go` (new), `internal/ui/recurcustom_test.go` (new), `internal/ui/itemforms.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/model/recurfield.go`, `internal/model/recurfield_test.go`, `internal/ui/recurfield_test.go`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.3.0 step 4: full-form Repeat dropdown + Detail-pane Repeats row

- Implemented the fourth v1.3.0 build step — a **Repeat dropdown** in both full forms, closing the recurrence-creation gap (a recurring item can now be made in the full form, not just quick-add, and an existing rule can be rewritten).
- **Pure state in model** (`internal/model/recurfield.go`, keeps rrule/ical out of `internal/ui`): `RepeatChoices` seeds the dropdown from an item's rule + anchor (`None · Daily · Weekly on <wd> · Monthly on day <n> · Yearly on <mon day> · Custom…`), adds a humanized entry for a representable non-preset rule or **"Custom rule (kept)"** for an unrepresentable one, and `Resolve(idx, finalAnchor)` maps a selection back to `Recur`/`RecurRemove` — rewrite-only-when-changed, presets re-derived from the final start date. Bare weekly normalizes to the Weekly preset. `RecurrenceSummary` renders the Detail-pane text.
- **UI wiring** (`internal/ui/itemforms.go`): `newEventForm`/`newTodoForm` take a `*model.RepeatChoices` (nil hides the field); read paths call `Resolve`. Scope wiring: create + edit-non-recurring + scope-All show it; **this-occurrence hides it** (nil); this-&-future shows it seeded at the occurrence. Scope-All event save routes a rule change/removal through `RewriteEventRule` and flashes "N edited occurrence(s) removed"; the split takes a changed rule for the future series. A repeating task requires a due date. Custom… entry present but **stubbed** (sub-form is step 5).
- **Detail pane** (`internal/ui/render.go`): recurring events/tasks show a **Repeats** row with the humanized rule (or `custom (FREQ=…)`); the old event "repeats" flag moved out of the Flags row.
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `internal/model/recurfield_test.go` (new) — seeding tables per rule shape + `Resolve` (create/remove/unchanged/changed/re-derive/kept). `internal/ui/recurfield_test.go` (new) — form read on create, seeded-untouched + None-removes, this-occurrence hides the field, task-needs-due.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`).
- Files: `internal/model/recurfield.go` (new), `internal/model/recurfield_test.go` (new), `internal/ui/itemforms.go`, `internal/ui/recur_edit.go`, `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/recurfield_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.3.0 step 3: recurrence rewrite primitives (Recur/RecurRemove, orphan pruning, split-with-new-rule)

- Implemented the third v1.3.0 build step — the model write paths for rewriting/removing an existing recurrence rule.
- **Drafts** (`internal/model/edit.go`): `EventDraft`/`TodoDraft` gained `RecurRemove bool` beside the existing `Recur *RecurSpec`. `applyEvent`/`applyTodo` now route recurrence through a shared `applyRecurrence`: nil + !remove leaves the RRULE untouched (iron rule — a semantically-equal rewrite could drop oddities like WKST), non-nil rewrites it, remove deletes the RRULE + EXDATE + RDATE. All-day series get a DATE-only UNTIL (`anchorIsDateOnly` → `dateOnlyUntil`, RFC 5545 §3.3.10).
- **Object-level rewrite** (`internal/model/recur_edit.go`): `RewriteEventRule(obj, uid, d, now, loc) (*Parsed, droppedOverrides, err)` applies the draft to the master and reconciles sibling RECURRENCE-ID overrides — drops **all** on Repeat→None, drops only **orphaned** ones (instant no longer in the new recurrence set) on a rule change; EXDATEs and unmodeled props (X-, VALARM) always preserved. Helpers `reconcileOverrides`, `occursInSet` (keeps an override on set-build uncertainty). Todos need no reconciliation (no overrides) so they go through `EditTodo`.
- **Split-with-new-rule**: `SplitEvent`/`NewSeriesFrom` gained the behavior for free — a draft `Recur` overwrites the copied+rebalanced rule (the explicit count becomes the future series' own end); a nil `Recur` keeps the existing COUNT-rebalance math.
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `internal/model/recurrewrite_test.go` (new) — rule change (new RRULE, EXDATE kept, X-/VALARM kept, valid override kept, orphan dropped, count), Repeat→None (all removed, plain event, count), all-day date-only UNTIL, todo rewrite+remove, split with/without a new rule. `FuzzRecurrenceMutations` extended over `RewriteEventRule` (rewrite + remove) and `EditTodo` recur/remove; ~1.6M execs clean.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`).
- Files: `internal/model/edit.go`, `internal/model/recur_edit.go`, `internal/model/recurrewrite_test.go` (new), `internal/model/fuzz_test.go`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.3.0 step 2: RecurSpec decomposer (RRULE → spec, conservative)

- Implemented the second v1.3.0 build step — `RecurSpecFromRule(*rrule.ROption, anchor)` (`internal/model/recurdecompose.go`), the RRULE→spec decomposer that seeds the Repeat form from an existing rule.
- **Conservative by design**: returns ok=false (rule stays "Custom (kept)", preserved byte-for-byte) for anything outside the vocabulary — BYSETPOS, sub-daily FREQ, BYYEARDAY/BYWEEKNO/BYHOUR/BYMINUTE/BYSECOND/BYEASTER, non-Monday WKST, nth-ordinal on a weekly rule, `MONTHLY;BYDAY=TU` (no ordinal), a 5th/other out-of-range nth, both COUNT and UNTIL, and any BYMONTH on monthly.
- **Anchor-contradiction rule**: a monthly BYMONTHDAY / nth-weekday, or a yearly BYMONTH/BYMONTHDAY, that disagrees with the DTSTART/DUE date returns ok=false (the editable set derives those from the start date, so a disagreeing rule can't be seeded faithfully). Helpers `decodeMonthly`, `decodeYearly`, `nthMatchesAnchor`, `rruleToWeekday`.
- **Round-trip identity**: every representable spec survives serialize→parse→decompose unchanged (mirrors the real path — go-ical's `RecurrenceRule()` calls `rrule.StrToROption`).
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `internal/model/recurdecompose_test.go` (new) — the round-trip identity table (daily/weekly/monthly-by-day/monthly-nth/last/yearly, interval/count/until), the unrepresentable catalogue (21 cases), and an anchor-consistent-accept complement. RED (undefined) before, green after.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`).
- Files: `internal/model/recurdecompose.go` (new), `internal/model/recurdecompose_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.3.0 step 1: RecurSpec extension (interval, weekday set, monthly nth, end conditions) + humanizer

- Implemented the first v1.3.0 build step — extended `RecurSpec` (`internal/model/quickadd.go`) to the full Google-custom vocabulary, zero-value compatible so quick-add behavior is unchanged.
- **New fields**: `Interval int` (0/1 = every), `Weekdays []time.Weekday` (the old `Weekday`/`HasWeekday` pair migrated into a slice), `MonthlyNth int` (1–4, −1 = last) + `MonthlyWeekday`, `Until *time.Time` / `Count int` (at most one). `Month`/`Day`/`HasMonthDay` (quick-add's "every jul 20" anchor) kept.
- **`ROption()` extended**: INTERVAL when >1; weekly weekday set → BYDAY; monthly nth-weekday → a single ordinaled BYDAY (`+4TU` / `-1TU`); UNTIL/COUNT. Monthly-by-day-of-month and yearly stay bare (the anchored DTSTART carries the day/date).
- **New `Humanize(anchor)`**: spec → "every 2 weeks on Tue, Thu until Dec 12, 2026" (interval-1 forms render "Weekly on Tue"). Anchor supplies the derived parts (plain-monthly day-of-month, yearly month/day, empty-weekday-set weekly). Helpers `humanizeWeekdays` (Monday-first sort), `mondayIndex`, `ordinal`.
- **Migration**: `parseEveryRecur` and `applyRecurAnchor` updated to `Weekdays`; `quickadd_recur_test.go` migrated to the slice field.
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `internal/model/recurspec_test.go` (new) — the extended `ROption().RRuleString()` table (interval/weekday-set/nth/last/until/count, bare monthly+yearly) and the `Humanize` table. RED (unknown fields / undefined Humanize) before, green after.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`).
- Files: `internal/model/quickadd.go`, `internal/model/quickadd_recur_test.go`, `internal/model/recurspec_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — Design: v1.3.0 recurrence-rule UI detailed build plan

- Planned v1.3.0 in detail with the owner (brainstorming session; all decisions owner-settled) and wrote the full design into `main.md`'s v1.3.0 Build Plan subsection, replacing the goal-level stub.
- Scope settled: **Google-custom parity** (owner benchmark: "every week on Tue and Thu until an end date") — frequency + interval + weekly weekday-set + both monthly flavors (day-of-month / nth-weekday incl. last, derived from the start date) + never/until/count ends; a **Repeat dropdown** with date-derived presets in both full forms plus a **Custom… nested sub-form** (color-picker focus-stack precedent); unrepresentable rules show **"Custom (kept)"** and are preserved byte-for-byte unless explicitly overwritten; **rewrite-only-when-changed** (seeded spec == read-back spec → RRULE untouched); Repeat→None drops the rule + EXDATEs/RDATEs/overrides; a changed rule keeps EXDATEs and still-valid overrides, drops orphaned ones (flash reports, undo restores).
- Approach chosen: extend the existing `RecurSpec` zero-value-compatibly (quick-add unchanged; one shared serialization path) over a parallel form-facing type or raw-RRULE-in-UI — plus a new conservative decomposer (`RecurSpecFromRule`) and humanizer.
- Six build steps defined (spec extension → decomposer → rewrite primitives → dropdown → sub-form → docs ripple), each with boundary-class tables and the `FuzzRecurrenceMutations` extension.
- No code change. The owner reviewed and approved the written plan the same day — implementation (build step 1) is the next session's starting point.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-23 — v1.2.0 released; post-release verification + docs

- The owner merged `ai-workspace` to `main` and tagged **v1.2.0**; the GitHub release published with the drafted "Smarter Quick-Add" release notes.
- Verified the release landed cleanly: tag/`main`/`ai-workspace` all at `a043292`; CI (push) green on `main` and the tag; the Release workflow completed successfully; all 8 binary assets present (darwin ×2, linux ×4, windows, `sha256sums.txt`); downloaded `lazyplanner_linux_amd64`, checksum matches `sha256sums.txt`, and it runs reporting `LazyPlanner v1.2.0`. (Benign GitHub Actions annotation only: Node 20 actions auto-upgraded to Node 24.)
- **`main.md`** updated in place: Current State and the v1.2.0 Build Plan subsection flipped from "implemented, awaiting release" to **released 2026-07-23**.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-22 — v1.2.0 step 6: docs ripple (help / README / main.md) — v1.2.0 build complete

- Final v1.2.0 build step — no code, docs brought current with the shipped grammar.
- **`:help`** (`internal/ui/help.go`): added a **Quick-add tokens** section (date / time / repeat / `!`priority / `#tag` / `@location` / rest) after the Create section.
- **README.md**: expanded the quick-add bullet (Usage) into a token list covering relative dates, time ranges, recurrence (noting it's the way to create a recurring item), `@location`, and the typo re-prompt.
- **main.md**: the `Creation: quick-add` design section **rewritten in place** to describe the full shipped grammar (date/time-range/recurrence/priority-tag-location slots, the anchoring rule, the obvious-error warning + keep-open re-prompt, and that the full form still can't rewrite a rule → v1.3.0). Current State updated (v1.2.0 implemented 2026-07-22, awaiting the owner's release; v1.3.0 next) and the v1.2.0 Build Plan subsection flipped from "(planned)" to "(implemented 2026-07-22)" with a Status line.
- **v1.2.0 is feature-complete**: all six build steps implemented repro-first with green full gates. Verified headlessly (boundary tables, the adversarial zero-warning table, extended fuzz with the warning-only-with-anchor invariant, UI create + re-prompt tests). Awaiting the owner's release/tag.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `go build ./...`).
- Files: `internal/ui/help.go`, `README.md`, `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-22 — v1.2.0 step 5: quick-add obvious-error warnings + keep-open re-prompt

- Implemented the fifth v1.2.0 build step — the parser now returns `Warnings []string` alongside the normal result; parsing never blocks (a failed token still falls to the title). Warnings fire **only on an unmistakable intent anchor**.
- Four warning classes (`internal/model/quickadd.go`): (1) `!`+alphanumerics that fail the priority parse (`!hgh`,`!t`,`!0`) or a duplicate priority token — punctuation runs (`!!!!`, `!`, `!?`) stay silent; (2) an unclosed `@"…` quote (`parseLocation` now *requires* the closing quote, so an unclosed span no longer silently becomes a location — a behavior tightening from step 4); (3) anchor-word fuzzy follower — `next X`/`every X`/`in N X` where X (≥4 chars) is Damerau–Levenshtein 1–2 from a weekday/month/unit full name (`osaDistance`; distance 0 = a real word, silent); (4) shape triggers — impossible colon-times (`25:00`,`12:99`; `http://…` safe), failed range shapes (`5-6xm`,`5pm-`), impossible ISO dates (`2026-07-40`, 4-digit-year-gated), and impossible three-part `m/d/y` (two-part slashed near-misses like `24/7`/`7/45` stay silent).
- **Keep-open re-prompt UX** (`internal/ui/edit.go`): the three quick-add creators route through a new `promptQuickAdd` — on submit with warnings nothing is created, the input stays open showing the first warning (accent → `warnColor`), and it remembers the warned text; an *identical* resubmit accepts as-is, any edit re-parses fresh, `Esc` cancels. Decision extracted to the pure `quickAddShouldReprompt`. `sd` (quick-set due) flashes the warning instead (no re-prompt), per spec.
- **Testing**: `internal/model/quickadd_warn_test.go` (new) — the **adversarial zero-warning title table asserted verbatim** (`My Event!!!!!`, `do it !`, `email bob@example.com`, `24/7 support`, `plan next steps fri`, `in 3 acts`, `http://x.com`, …), the positive four-class warning table, correct-spelling-is-silent, and a warning-names-the-token check. `FuzzParseQuickAdd` extended with new-grammar + warning seeds, `HasEnd`/`EndAt` range+panic checks, and a **new invariant** — a warning only ever fires alongside an intent anchor (independent coarse detector `hasIntentAnchor`); ~1M execs clean. `internal/ui/quickwarn_test.go` (new) — the `quickAddShouldReprompt` table and an end-to-end re-prompt drive through the focused input field (first Enter no create, identical resubmit creates, edit-to-clean creates the edited item).
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`); short `go test -fuzz` exploration clean.
- Files: `internal/model/quickadd.go`, `internal/model/fuzz_test.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/quickfield.go`, `internal/model/quickadd_warn_test.go` (new), `internal/ui/quickwarn_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-22 — v1.2.0 step 4: quick-add @location

- Implemented the fourth v1.2.0 build step — an `@location` slot in the quick-add parser (first match wins).
- Forms: `@cafeteria` (single word) and `@"room 204"` (quoted multi-word span). A lone `@` and empty quotes stay in the title (`lunch @ noon`); an embedded `@` is inert (`email bob@example.com`).
- **Pre-lexer** (`lexQuickAdd`) replaces `strings.Fields` — output is identical except a token-leading `@"…"` span is held together across spaces; an unclosed quote consumes to end-of-input as one token, leaving it detectably unclosed for the v1.2.0 step-5 warning pass. `parseLocation` extracts the value; a quoted span is never re-parsed (so `@"jul 20"` is a location, not a date).
- `QuickAdd` gained `Location`; the loop handles `@` in the existing sigil switch (first-match-wins).
- **Model plumbing**: `Todo` gained a `Location` field (parsed from VTODO `LOCATION` in `ParseTodo`); `TodoDraft` gained `Location`, serialized by `applyTodo` via `setTextOrDel` (LOCATION is legal on a VTODO; NextCloud Tasks shows it). `EventDraft`/`applyEvent`/`Event` already carried LOCATION.
- **UI**: `createEvent`/`createTask` pass `qa.Location`; `setTodoDetail` (`internal/ui/render.go`) gained a `Location` row shown when non-empty (mirrors the event Detail pane).
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `internal/model/quickadd_location_test.go` (new) — the location table (single/quoted/bare-@/empty-quotes/quoted-not-a-date/first-match-wins/embedded-@) and a VTODO LOCATION round-trip. `internal/ui/quicklocation_test.go` (new) — location flows into a created event and task, and the task Detail pane shows the row.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`).
- Files: `internal/model/quickadd.go`, `internal/model/edit.go`, `internal/model/todo.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/model/quickadd_location_test.go` (new), `internal/ui/quicklocation_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-22 — v1.2.0 step 3: quick-add simple recurrence

- Implemented the third v1.2.0 build step — simple recurrence in the quick-add parser. **This is the first in-app way to create a recurring item** (closing the gap acknowledged 2026-07-22).
- Grammar (one slot, first match wins, events and tasks alike): bare `daily`/`weekly`/`monthly`/`yearly`, `every day/week/month/year`, `every <weekday>` (weekly on that day, `BYDAY`), and `every <month> <day>` (yearly on that date).
- **Anchoring rule** (`applyRecurAnchor`, run after the token loop so an explicit date parsed anywhere wins): a form implying a specific date sets the start/due when none was typed — `every mon` → the soonest Monday, `every jul 20` → the next Jul 20; bare/`every <unit>` forms imply no date (the context day is used via `At`). An explicit date always wins and anchors the series.
- New model types (`internal/model/quickadd.go`): `RecurFreq` + `FreqDaily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly`, `RecurSpec` (Freq + optional Weekday / Month+Day), `RecurSpec.ROption()` (rrule-go option — DTSTART anchors the series, so the rule carries only FREQ and, for weekday forms, BYDAY), and `weekdayToRRule`. `QuickAdd` gained `Recur *RecurSpec`; parser helpers `parseRecur`/`parseEveryRecur`. Model stays pure (rrule-go already a model dependency).
- **Serialization**: `EventDraft`/`TodoDraft` gained `Recur *RecurSpec`; `applyEvent`/`applyTodo` set the RRULE via `SetRecurrenceRule` **only when non-nil** — an edit (nil Recur) never touches an existing RRULE (iron rule; rewriting a rule is the planned v1.3.0 feature). `isRecurring` already flags the created object from RRULE presence, so the existing single-live-instance-todo and scope-picker machinery keys off it with no changes.
- **UI wiring** (`internal/ui/edit.go`): `createEvent`/`createTask` pass `qa.Recur` into the draft.
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `internal/model/quickadd_recur_test.go` (new) — the full grammar table incl. anchoring + explicit-date-wins + the `daily standup 9am` accepted trade-off + non-matches (`everyone`, trailing `every`, `every so often`); `RRuleString` per form; and an event+todo serialize-back-as-recurring check. `internal/ui/quickrecur_test.go` (new) — `createEvent`/`createTask` produce recurring objects with the right RRULE, event anchored to Monday not the base day.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`).
- Files: `internal/model/quickadd.go`, `internal/model/edit.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/model/quickadd_recur_test.go` (new), `internal/ui/quickrecur_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-22 — v1.2.0 step 2: quick-add time ranges

- Implemented the second v1.2.0 build step — time ranges in the quick-add parser. One `start-end` token where at least one half carries a colon or am/pm fills the first-time-wins slot; two bare numbers (`3-4`) never read as a time.
- Semantics: a right-side am/pm distributes to a bare left half (`5-6pm` = 5pm–6pm); an ISO date's two dashes never match (`strings.Cut` on the first `-`, rejecting a second dash in the right half); each half parses like `parseClock` except a bare number is read as 24-hour.
- `QuickAdd` gained `HasEnd`/`EndHour`/`EndMinute` and an `EndAt(start)` helper that places the end on the start's day, rolling to the next day when it is at or before the start (`11pm-1am` crosses midnight).
- Refactored `parseClock` to share a `parseTimeHalf` core with the new `parseTimeRange`; added `hasTimeMarker`/`ampmSuffix` helpers. Existing `parseClock` behavior (bare number rejected) is unchanged.
- **UI wiring** (`internal/ui/edit.go`): `createEvent` now applies the range end via `EndAt` (the 1-hour default still applies when no end is given); `createTask` is unchanged — it uses `qa.At` (the start), so a task's due time is the range start and the end is ignored (documented behavior).
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `internal/model/quickadd_timerange_test.go` (new) — the range table (distribution, explicit halves, 24-hour, cross-midnight, 12am/12pm, two-bare-numbers, single-time-no-end), the ISO-date-not-a-range guard, and the `EndAt` rollover boundary (after/before/equal). `internal/ui/timerange_test.go` (new) — `createEvent` same-day + cross-midnight rollover, no-range 1-hour default, and `createTask` using the range start (loc pinned to UTC for a deterministic zone).
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`).
- Files: `internal/model/quickadd.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/model/quickadd_timerange_test.go` (new), `internal/ui/timerange_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-22 — v1.2.0 step 1: quick-add relative dates

- Implemented the first v1.2.0 build step — relative dates in the quick-add smart parser (`internal/model/quickadd.go`), extending `parseDate` (no rewrite of the single-pass loop).
- New forms: `next <weekday>` = the bare-weekday result **+7 days** (single rule, no week-start dependence — `next fri` on a Friday is a full week out), `next week` = today+7, `next month` = same day-of-month next month clamped to its last day, and `in N days/weeks/months` (singular units too; N is 1–3 ASCII digits; months clamp like `next month`).
- Helpers added: `parseNextDate`, `parseInDate`, `isAllDigits`, `addMonthsClamped` (manual day-of-month clamp — `time.Date` would spill Jan 31 + 1 month into March), `daysInMonth`.
- Conservative by design: an anchor word with no valid follower stays in the title (`meeting in room 5`, `next steps`, `next year`, `in 2026 days`, `in 5 minutes` all parse no date).
- **Free riders**: `:goto` and `sd` (quick-set due date) call `ParseQuickAdd`, so they gained the whole relative-date family with no UI change.
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `internal/model/quickadd_relative_test.go` (new) — main table (both matches and title-fallthrough non-matches), `next fri`-on-a-Friday boundary, and the month-clamp boundary (non-leap Feb 28, leap Feb 29, `in 1 month` parity). All RED before the change (feature missing), green after.
- Full gate green (`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`).
- Files: `internal/model/quickadd.go`, `internal/model/quickadd_relative_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-22 — Plan: v1.3.0 is now the recurrence-rule UI; SELECT mode deferred to v1.4.0

- Owner decision: the recurrence-rule UI (full-form Repeat field + rewriting an existing rule) gets its own version, v1.3.0; SELECT mode moves to v1.4.0.
- **`main.md`** Build Plan updated: the SELECT-mode subsection renumbered to `### v1.4.0` (content unchanged, deferral noted); a new goal-level `### v1.3.0 — recurrence-rule UI` subsection added; the Future-versions candidate bullet for the recurrence UI removed (now versioned); Current State and the Creation section's cross-reference updated in place.
- No code change; v1.2.0 implementation is next.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-22 — Docs: recurrence-creation gap acknowledged; full-form Repeat field deferred

- Investigation (owner question): as of v1.1.0 a recurring task/event **cannot be created in-app** — quick-add has no recurrence tokens and neither full form has a repeat field (`internal/ui/itemforms.go`); the rule itself is also not rewritable (scope pickers edit occurrences, never the RRULE). Recurrence support is manage-existing only.
- Root cause of the miss: a spec seam — build step 8 built creation before recurrence existed, step 11 was scoped to *editing* semantics, and no design section ever specified recurrence creation. Four feature-promise/spec-diff audits (10, 13, 17, 18) passed it legitimately: the code conforms to the spec; the hole is spec≠intent, invisible to spec-diff. The one catchable thread — main.md listing recurrence as a surfaced event field while the Creation section claimed the full form "edits every field" — spans distant sections, and the audit method extracts promises row-by-row rather than composing them.
- **main.md** updated in place: the Creation section's "edits every field" corrected (recurrence rule excepted; quick-add v1.2.0 becomes the first in-app creation path); Future versions gains a **Recurrence-rule UI in the full forms** candidate (owner deferral 2026-07-22).
- Follow-up noted for the next feature-promise audit pass: add a lifecycle × surfaced-field completeness matrix (every surfaced field reachable at create and edit) to the method set — it catches this class mechanically.
- No code change.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-22 — Design: v1.2.0 quick-add parser improvements detailed build plan

- Planned v1.2.0 in detail with the owner (brainstorming session; all decisions owner-settled) and wrote the full design into `main.md`'s v1.2.0 Build Plan subsection, replacing the goal-level stub.
- Scope settled: **time ranges** (`5-6pm`, cross-midnight rollover; tasks use the start), **simple recurrence** (`daily`…, `every <weekday>`, `every <month> <day>`; tasks and events; anchoring rule), **relative dates** (`next <weekday>` = bare+7d, `next week/month`, `in N days/weeks/months`), **`@location`** (quoted multi-word form; stored on tasks too + a task Detail-pane Location row), and **obvious-error warnings** (intent-anchor principle: sigil/anchor-word/fuzzy-follower/shape triggers only; space-delimited tokens only — embedded sigils inert; punctuation runs like `My Event!!!!!` never warn) with a **keep-input-open re-prompt** (identical resubmit accepts as-is).
- Approach chosen: extend the existing fuzz-hardened single-pass token loop (rewrite and NL-library rejected); `QuickAdd` gains `HasEnd`/`Recur *RecurSpec`/`Location`/`Warnings`.
- Six build steps defined (relative dates → time ranges → recurrence → location → warnings+UX → docs ripple), each with boundary-class tests, an adversarial zero-warning title table, and an extended fuzz target.
- No code change; implementation follows owner review of the written plan.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-22 — Plan: v1.2.0 is now quick-add parser improvements; SELECT mode deferred to v1.3.0

- Owner decision: SELECT mode moves from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0; v1.2.0 becomes improvements to the quick-add auto-parser for event/task creation.
- **`main.md`** Build Plan updated: the SELECT-mode subsection renumbered to `### v1.3.0` (content unchanged, deferral noted); a new goal-level `### v1.2.0 — quick-add parser improvements` subsection added (detailed design to be written there before implementation); Current State's next-version line updated in place.
- No code change; detailed v1.2.0 planning is the next step.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-22 — v1.1.0 released; post-release verification + docs

- The owner merged `ai-workspace` to `main` and tagged **v1.1.0**; the GitHub release published with the drafted release notes.
- Verified the release landed cleanly: tag/`main`/`ai-workspace` all at `87965a4`; Release + CI workflows green; all 8 binary assets present; downloaded `lazyplanner_linux_amd64`, checksum matches `sha256sums.txt`, and it runs reporting v1.1.0.
- **`main.md`** updated in place: Current State and the v1.1.0 Build Plan subsection flipped from "release in progress" to **released 2026-07-22**.
- Session cleanup: checkout was left on `main` after the owner's release — switched back to `ai-workspace`; no residual worktrees, branches, or stray files.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-22 — v1.1.0 live verification passed; release prep

- The CalDAV server is back up and the owner ran the live two-account end-to-end sync verification — **passed**. This was the last gate before the v1.1.0 release; the owner tags the release on GitHub.
- Pre-release sweep found no blockers: working tree clean, no code TODOs, `notes.md` empty, full gate green (`make check` — build, tests, vet, staticcheck), release diff v1.0.2→HEAD is exactly the 17 v1.1.0 + Pass 18 commits.
- **`main.md`** updated in place: Current State and the v1.1.0 Build Plan subsection flipped from "pending live verification" to verified/complete (2026-07-22).
- Release notes for the GitHub release drafted and handed to the owner.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — Docs: Pass 18 ledger reconciled to the fixes; notes cleared

- All three Pass 18 findings and all four canary holes are now fixed (four commits above), so the audit record is brought current.
- **`docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`**: the Sync-engine, feature-promise, multi-account-config-parse, and `:account` rows flipped their Pass 18 findings from **CONFIRMED, UNFIXED** to **FIXED** (with the fix summary + repro path each); the Global-state and switch-loop rows flipped their canary **ESCAPE** notes to **CLOSED**; the Mouse-handling row gained the `treeNodeAtY` boundary-canary closure (last pass → 10,16,18). The blind-spots list marked the three findings + the canary-holes bullet **RESOLVED** (sync-core TOCTOU stays a warm-but-shallow re-sweep target beyond the CommitPush window). The "pass 18 canaries" section retitled **all CLOSED** with each bullet's guard test named and its verified RED mutation.
- **`notes.md`**: the mid-arc handoff task is complete — cleared back to the empty steady state (resolution lives here in `log.md`).
- No code change; full gate re-run green as a sanity check.
- Files: `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`, `notes.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — Fix (Pass 18 canaries): close the 4 escaped mutation-canary holes

- Pass 18 reported 4/4 canary escapes — test-net holes, not code bugs (the code is correct). Added a boundary regression test for each and **verified each catches its mutation** (applied the mutation → RED, reverted → GREEN), so the guards aren't vacuous:
  1. **`internal/config` `permissionWarning`** — `permission_warning_test.go`: a group-readable `0o640` config must warn (a password-bearing file). Mutation `0o077→0o007` (other-only mask) drops the group bit → test RED.
  2. **`internal/state` `Save`/`SaveGlobal`** — `state_mode_test.go`: both write `0o600` (shared `writeJSONFile`); the mode contract was unasserted. Mutation `0o600→0o644` → test RED (Unix-only; `runtime.GOOS` guard).
  3. **`cmd/lazyplanner` `components()`** — `calendar_helpers_test.go`: pins default↔VEVENT, `--tasks`↔VTODO, `--both`↔both (+ previously-uncovered `slugify` and `joinWarnings`). Mutation swapping `--tasks` to VEVENT → test RED.
  4. **`internal/ui` `treeNodeAtY`** — `treenodeaty_test.go`: a click exactly one row past the last node (idx==len). Mutation `idx >= len`→`idx > len` indexes `visible[len]` and panics the TUI → test RED (caught via recover, reported cleanly).
- All four green on the real code; full gate green (`make check`).
- Files: `internal/config/permission_warning_test.go` (new), `internal/state/state_mode_test.go` (new), `cmd/lazyplanner/calendar_helpers_test.go` (new), `internal/ui/treenodeaty_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — Fix (Pass 18 #2): bound the O(depth²) TOML decode so a crafted config can't hang startup

- **Bug**: `maxConfigBytes` (4 MiB) bounds the config *read*, not the decode *CPU*, and `Load` had no other bound. BurntSushi/toml decodes deeply nested inline tables/arrays in O(depth²) time, so a deeply-nested config well under 4 MiB hangs `Load()`/startup for minutes-to-hours (re-measured this session: depth 500→25 ms, 1000→100 ms, 2000→331 ms, 4000→1.1 s — clean quadratic; a 4 MiB file reaches ~700 K depth). Threat model is a local corrupted/crafted config (not remote), but it defeats the read cap's stated "never hang startup" purpose — fixed for consistency with that invariant.
- **Fix** (`internal/config/config.go`): a deterministic pre-decode guard `checkNestingDepth` scans the raw bytes and rejects structural bracket nesting (`{}`/`[]`) past `maxTOMLNestingDepth` (64) *before* calling `toml.Decode`, returning the same fatal, actionable error style as the syntax-error branch. Chose a depth cap over a decode timeout because it's O(n), deterministic, and testable without timing flakiness. The scanner skips brackets inside strings (basic/literal, single- and multi-line, with escapes) and comments, so it never false-rejects a real config (a password full of braces, a URL with `[]`); 64 is ~32× above any legitimate config (max real nesting ≈ 2 for `[[account]]`) yet keeps decode cost microseconds.
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `internal/config/config_decode_bound_test.go` (new) — `TestLoadDoesNotHangOnDeeplyNestedConfig` (a ~120 KB depth-20000 config; asserts `Load` returns within 2 s — RED hung >2 s before the fix, instant after) and `TestCheckNestingDepth` (deterministic boundary: shallow config with brackets only in strings/comments passes, at-cap passes, one-past-cap rejected).
- Full gate green (`make check`).
- Files: `internal/config/config.go`, `internal/config/config_decode_bound_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — Fix (Pass 18 #3, MED): `:config` reload now refreshes the account list

- **Bug**: `applyConfigReload` (`internal/ui/command.go`) never touched `a.accounts`/`a.activeAccount` (set once in `Run`), and `ConfigReload` carried no account list, so a `:config`-added or -renamed `[[account]]` stayed invisible in the picker + status bar and unreachable via `:account` (flashed "unknown account") until a full process restart — contradicting main.md:340 ("the reload re-parses the account list; picker/status bar update live").
- **Scope clarification** (per the notes): this fix only makes a newly-added account **visible/selectable**; the actual switch is still `:account`'s teardown-and-rebuild (unchanged). A reload still **cannot** hot-swap the *active* account's connection — `editConfigFn`'s existing "connection changed or removed → use :account or restart" error is preserved, and on that (or any) reload error `applyConfigReload` returns early without touching the live list.
- **Fix**:
  - `ConfigReload` (`internal/ui/app.go`) gains `Accounts []string` + `ActiveAccount string`.
  - `editConfigFn` (`cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`) populates them on a successful reload: `accountNames(cfg)` and the running account's (possibly renamed — same cache id) `acct.Name`.
  - `applyConfigReload` adopts `res.Accounts` when non-nil and `res.ActiveAccount` when non-empty, so the picker/status/`:account` see the fresh list.
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `internal/ui/configreload_accounts_test.go` (new) — `TestConfigReloadRefreshesAccountList` (an added account becomes reachable: `switchAccount` records it instead of flashing unknown), `TestConfigReloadTracksRenamedActiveAccount` (a renamed active account's label follows), `TestConfigReloadErrorLeavesAccountsUntouched` (a failed reload preserves the live list + flashes). The first two RED before the fix, green after; the third guards the preserved error path.
- Full gate green (`make check`).
- Files: `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/command.go`, `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `internal/ui/configreload_accounts_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — Fix (Pass 18 #1, HIGH): CommitPush no longer resurrects a resource deleted mid-push

- **Bug**: `store.CommitPush` treated `cur == nil` (the event loop deleted the resource while the sync goroutine's PUT was in flight) identically to `cur == pushed` (unchanged) — it rebuilt the resource clean via `writeResourceLocked`, and `stageResourceLocked`'s unconditional `delete(cs.tombstones, name)` then wiped the pending deletion. A user delete landing during a background push was silently, permanently lost (next sync a no-op). Reachable with periodic/debounced sync running.
- **Fix** (`internal/store/remote.go`): `CommitPush` now reads `cur` under the lock and, when `cur == nil`, honors the deletion instead of resurrecting it — new `honorMidPushDeleteLocked` **ensures a tombstone** carrying the post-PUT href/ETag and persists the sidecar. This covers both push variants that route through `CommitPush`:
  - **pushUpdate** (synced resource): the local `Delete` already left a tombstone with the *pre-push* ETag; the PUT changed the server ETag, so the tombstone's ETag is **advanced** to the new value or the next conditional DELETE (`If-Match`) would 412.
  - **pushCreate** (never-synced create, `Href==""`): the local `Delete` left **no** tombstone (no server identity yet), but the create-PUT just made the resource on the server — a tombstone is **created** so the next sync deletes it, else step (B) re-pulls and silently resurrects it.
  When `cur != nil` the finalize logic is unchanged (clean if still `pushed`, else keep the newer content dirty and advance the ETag baseline).
- **Repro-first (TDD)**: `internal/store/commitpush_deletemidpush_test.go` (new) — `TestCommitPushDoesNotResurrectDeletedResource` (synced/pushUpdate case, asserts tombstone survives + ETag advances), `TestCommitPushHonorsDeleteOfNeverSyncedCreate` (create/pushCreate case, asserts a tombstone is created with the server href/ETag), and `TestCommitPushDeleteRaceInvariant` (200× concurrent Delete‖CommitPush, ordering-independent invariant: exactly 1 tombstone + 0 resurrected resource; passes under `-race`). All three RED before the fix, green after.
- Full gate green (`make check`, incl. `-race` on the store seam).
- Files: `internal/store/remote.go`, `internal/store/commitpush_deletemidpush_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — Hardening Pass 18: v1.1.0 multi-account surface + deep sync-core TOCTOU re-sweep

- Ran the `/audit` workflow scoped to the v1.1.0 surface (four targets: `internal/ui` switch/sync race, `cmd/lazyplanner` switch loop, `internal/config` multi-account parse, `internal/state` global file) plus the plan pulled in the long-deferred deep sync-core TOCTOU re-sweep (last deep pass 11). 30 agents, ~1.3M tokens. **Findings are CONFIRMED but UNFIXED — fixing is a separate deliberate step (owner to decide).**
- **HIGH ×2, MED ×1 (all verified, repros ran):**
  1. **`store.CommitPush` resurrects a resource deleted mid-push** (`internal/store/remote.go:83`) — the callback treats `cur==nil` (event-loop deleted the resource while the sync goroutine's PUT was in flight) the same as `cur==pushed`, rebuilding it clean; `stageResourceLocked` then wipes the tombstone. A user delete landing during an edit-push is silently, permanently lost (next sync a no-op). Real two-goroutine race. Same for the `pushCreate` variant. Repro confirmed RED (`commitpush_deletemidpush_test.go`, preserved to scratchpad — removed from tree so the gate stays green until the fix).
  2. **O(depth²) TOML decode hangs startup within the read cap** (`internal/config/config.go:195`) — `maxConfigBytes` bounds bytes, not decode CPU, and `Load` has no timeout; a deeply-nested-inline-table config under 4 MiB hangs for minutes-to-hours (measured 32 KB→3.36 s, quadratic). Threat model is a local corrupted/crafted config (not remote), which tempers real-world severity, but it defeats the read cap's stated purpose.
  3. **`:config` reload doesn't refresh the account list** (`internal/ui/command.go` `applyConfigReload`) — `ConfigReload` carries no account list, so a `:config`-added/renamed account stays invisible in the picker/status and unreachable via `:account` until restart. **This contradicts a promise I wrote in main.md:340** — so it's a real code-vs-doc gap (fix the code, not the doc).
- **Canary escapes: 4/4** (test-net holes, not code bugs): config group-readable-password warning mask, `state.Save` 0o600 mode contract, the CLI `components()` events↔VEVENT/tasks↔VTODO helper, and a `treeNodeAtY` off-by-one (`idx>len`) that could panic the TUI on a double-click one row past the last node. Second consecutive 4/4-escape pass — the regression net hasn't reached the v1.1.0 / sibling code yet.
- **Convergence: trending UP (2→3 findings; HIGH 0→2)** — expected, since this pass opened the entire never-audited v1.1.0 stack + the oldest heavy surface (sync-core). It **breaks, not extends, the no-HIGH streak.**
- **Security note**: two canary subagents' permission-weakening mutations triggered security warnings; verified they ran only in disposable worktrees and did **not** touch the working tree (`config.go` still `0o077`, `state.go` still `0o600`). Cleaned up: removed 4 leftover worktrees + their branches, removed the leaked RED repro from the tree.
- Artifacts: `docs/audit/passes/PASS-18.md` (full report), `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md` (ledger updated — new v1.1.0 rows, sync-core row reopened, blind spots refreshed). Gate green after cleanup.
- Files: `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`, `docs/audit/passes/PASS-18.md` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — Fix (v1.1.0): `:account` picker highlight was illegible (white-on-white)

- **Bug**: the highlighted row in the `:account` picker was unreadable — reverse of the intent. Root cause: `accountPickerList` (`internal/ui/command.go`) created a `tview.List` but never set a selected style, so it fell back to tview's default (`vendor/.../tview/list.go:109`: foreground = `Styles.PrimitiveBackgroundColor`, background = `Styles.PrimaryTextColor`). Under `useTerminalTheme`'s `PrimitiveBackgroundColor = ColorDefault`, that renders terminal-default text (white on a dark terminal) on a white bar → white-on-white. Every other list in the app already avoids this via the shared `selectionStyle` (`SetSelectedStyle`); the v1.1.0 picker was the one that missed it.
- **Fix**: `accountPickerList` now calls `list.SetSelectedStyle(selectionStyle)` (the shared reverse-video style, theme-adaptive), matching `calendars`/`tasklists`/`agendaList` and the conflicts list.
- **Repro-first**: `internal/ui/account_test.go` `TestAccountPickerSelectionIsLegible` draws the picker and asserts the selected row carries the reverse attribute (mirrors the existing `TestSelectionIsLegible` for the app's lists). Verified RED on the old code (no reverse), green after the fix.
- **Recurring class → guardrail**: this is the second appearance of the white-on-white selection class, so added a Hard-won guardrail to CLAUDE.md — *every `tview.List` must `SetSelectedStyle(selectionStyle)`* (tview's default is illegible under our terminal-default theme) — with the two legibility regression tests cited. Add one for any new list.
- Full gate green (`make check`).

## 2026-07-21 — v1.1.0 step 5: docs ripple (README + main.md rewritten in place); feature complete

- Final step of v1.1.0 — the docs now describe the shipped multi-account feature (deferred to last so they never described a half-built switcher).
- **README**: Configuration section rewritten around `[[account]]` blocks (two-account example, unique-name rule, one-active-at-a-time, no merged view) with an **upgrade blockquote** (rename `[server]` → `[[account]]`, cache reused, refuses to start on a leftover `[server]`); `global.json` last-active memory noted. Usage gains a `:account` bullet and the `:config` note now says the active account's connection can't be hot-swapped (use `:account`/restart); `:account` added to the `:` command summary. Remaining `[server]` mentions are all intentional migration guidance.
- **main.md** (Settled Decisions rewritten **in place**, per the maintenance rule): the **Account model** decision flipped from "single-account, cheap safeguard" to "multiple accounts, one active, `:account` switcher, teardown-and-rebuild, `global.json` last-active memory, first-block fallback, switch-open fallback"; **Config file** and **Config editing model** updated for `[[account]]` + the `:config`/`:account` split; **defaults** note now "one `[[account]]` block". The v1.1.0 Build Plan subsection marked **implemented (pending live verification + owner release)** with a status line; **Current State** updated to note the move into feature versions. v1.0.0 Build Plan history (step 9's cache-namespacing narrative) left intact per the completed-versions-stay-as-history convention.
- **In-app help** (`?`) already updated in step 4 (`:account` row). No code changed this step; sanity build + ui/config/cmd tests still green.
- **v1.1.0 is feature-complete on `ai-workspace`** across all 5 steps. Remaining before an owner release: live two-account end-to-end sync verification once the CalDAV server is back (headless coverage is complete).
- Full gate green (docs-only; build + tests re-run as a sanity check).
- Files: `README.md`, `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — v1.1.0 step 4: `:account` command + picker + status-bar segment

- Fourth step of v1.1.0 (TDD). The account switcher is now user-reachable: `:account` triggers the teardown-and-rebuild wired in step 3.
- **`internal/ui/command.go`**: `:account`/`:acct` command. `:account <name>` switches directly; bare `:account` opens a picker modal (a bordered `tview.List` of account names, the active one marked `(active)`, Enter switches / Esc cancels). `switchAccount` validates the target against the configured names case-insensitively — unknown → flash, already-active → no-op flash, otherwise `requestSwitch` sets `a.switchTo` and calls `a.tv.Stop()`, so Run's existing clean-exit path (cancel in-flight sync, best-effort `flushOnQuit`) runs before returning the switch to main. No accounts configured → "no accounts configured".
- **`internal/ui/app.go`**: `Options.Accounts`/`ActiveAccount` and matching `app` fields, wired in `Run`.
- **`internal/ui/render.go`**: `updateStatus` names the active account (escaped — statusLeft has dynamic color tags) only when more than one account is configured, so single-account/offline runs stay uncluttered.
- **`internal/ui/help.go`**: `?` help lists `:account` and adds it to the `:` command summary.
- **`cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`**: `openAccountAndRun` passes `accountNames(cfg)` + `acct.Name` into `ui.Options` (new `accountNames` helper).
- **Tests**: `internal/ui/account_test.go` (new) — valid switch records the request, case-insensitive match, active-is-noop, unknown flashes, status shows the name only when >1, `:account` dispatch through `runCommand`, no-accounts flash. `internal/ui/displaystress_test.go` — `TestAccountPickerStress` draws the picker with hostile names across the 1×1→400×150 geometry matrix. All RED before impl, green after.
- **End-to-end smoke via the built binary**: a legacy `[server]` config prints the migration error and exits non-zero; a fresh run generates the `[[account]]` starter template. (The TUI itself can't launch headlessly — no tty — so live switching is verified by the unit tests + deferred to manual/live testing.)
- Full gate green: build, `go test ./...`, vet, staticcheck, gofmt.
- Files: `internal/ui/command.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/help.go`, `internal/ui/account_test.go` (new), `internal/ui/displaystress_test.go`, `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — v1.1.0 step 3: account switch-and-rebuild loop (cmd) + `ui.Run` switch result

- Third step of v1.1.0 (TDD). The app can now, in principle, run any configured account and reopen a different one without exiting — the teardown-and-rebuild mechanism. Nothing triggers a switch yet (that's step 4's `:account` command); this step builds and tests the loop, the resolvers, and the UI return path.
- **`internal/config/config.go`**: two pure resolvers — `ResolveActiveAccount(activeID)` (the account matching the stored last-active id, else the first block, so a removed/renamed account can't strand the user) and `Account(name)` (case-insensitive switch-target lookup for `:account`).
- **`internal/ui/app.go`**: `Run` now returns `(RunResult, error)`; `RunResult.SwitchAccount` is empty for a quit or names the account to switch to. New `app.switchTo` field carries the request (set by step 4's command) and is read on the clean-exit path after `flushOnQuit`.
- **`cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`**: `runTUI` split into (1) `runTUILoop(cfg, globalPath, openAndRun)` — the switch-and-rebuild state machine: resolves the active account from the global state file, persists the active id before opening (so the file always names the current account), reopens on each switch request, and **falls back to the previously-working account** if a switch target fails to open (a second failure with no fallback left, or an initial-open failure, is fatal); (2) `openAccountAndRun(cfg, acct)` — the per-account wiring (open store/state/sync, run the UI) injected into the loop so the loop is testable without a real store/terminal. `store.Open` holds no OS handles/locks (files are opened per-op), so the old app is simply GC'd on switch — no leak.
- **`editConfigFn`**: now takes the running `config.Account` and rebuilds sync for the account whose cache id still matches after a reload; a changed/removed active connection flashes "use :account or restart", while an **offline run** (no configured account) reloads cleanly (appearance + warnings) instead of erroring. Fixes the step-1 shim that compared against `FirstAccount` regardless of which account was active.
- **Tests**: `internal/config/config_test.go` (`TestResolveActiveAccount`, `TestAccountLookupByName`); `cmd/lazyplanner/accountloop_test.go` (new — quit persists active, stored-id resolution, switch reopens + repersists, fallback on failed switch-open, fatal initial-open error, unknown-target quits cleanly). Migrated `TestConfigReloadPreservesLoadWarning` to pass a zero (offline) account. All RED before impl, green after.
- **Residual (documented)**: the active id is persisted just before open, so a crash in the sub-millisecond window between persisting a switch target and its store opening could, on next launch, try an unopenable target first (fatal). Extremely unlikely; not engineered around.
- Full gate green: build, `go test ./...`, vet, staticcheck, gofmt.
- Files: `internal/config/config.go`, `internal/config/config_test.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `cmd/lazyplanner/accountloop_test.go` (new), `cmd/lazyplanner/configreload_warning_test.go`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — v1.1.0 step 2: global state file for the last-active account

- Second step of v1.1.0 (TDD). A new cross-account state file at the data-dir root remembers which account was active, so the app reopens it next launch (per-account `state.json` files stay where they are, under each account dir).
- **`internal/state/global.go`** (new): `Global` struct with `ActiveAccountID` (the `config.AccountID`, empty = no preference), `LoadGlobal`/`SaveGlobal` at `GlobalFileName` (`global.json`). Corrupt/missing → zero `Global` (never blocks startup); writes are atomic (temp+rename).
- **`internal/state/state.go`**: refactored the capped-read and atomic-write out of `Load`/`Save` into shared unexported helpers `readJSONFile`/`writeJSONFile`, so `State` and `Global` share one implementation (no duplicated read-cap/temp-rename logic). The existing `TestSaveWritesViaTempFile` now exercises the extracted `writeJSONFile` via `Save`, so the atomicity guard covers both types.
- **Tests** (`internal/state/global_test.go`, new): `TestGlobalRoundTrip`, `TestLoadGlobalMissingIsZero`, `TestLoadGlobalCorruptIsZero` — all RED before the impl, green after.
- Not yet wired into `cmd` — step 3 (the cmd loop) reads/writes this file to resolve the active account and persist a switch.
- Full gate green: build, `go test ./...`, vet, staticcheck, gofmt.
- Files: `internal/state/global.go` (new), `internal/state/state.go`, `internal/state/global_test.go` (new), `log.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — v1.1.0 step 1: multi-account config schema (`[[account]]` + migration error)

- First implementation step of v1.1.0 account switching (TDD, all tests written/failing before code). Config package now parses the multi-account schema; the single `[server]` section is removed.
- **`internal/config/config.go`**: `Config.Server` → `Config.Accounts []Account`. New `Account` type = a unique `name` + embedded `Server` (so the connection fields and credential logic — `ResolvePassword`/`Configured` — are shared, and the `Server` type + its tests are untouched). `Load` now captures `toml.Decode`'s `MetaData` and: (1) rejects a leftover `[server]` via `meta.IsDefined("server")` with an actionable migration message (else it would be silently ignored → zero accounts, no explanation); (2) runs `validateAccounts` — every block needs a non-empty name, names unique case-insensitively (the name is the switch key). Zero accounts stays valid (offline run). Added `Account.ID()` (cache-namespacing id from the connection; the migration keeps the same cache) and `Config.FirstAccount()` (trivial active-account resolver until step 2's state file).
- **`internal/config/template.go`**: first-run template emits a named `[[account]]` block (`name = "personal"`) with a commented second-account example, and the header explains `:account` switching.
- **`cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`**: minimal shim to keep the app functional/buildable pending step 3 — `runTUI` and the `:config` reload closure resolve `cfg.FirstAccount()` instead of `cfg.Server` (single active account = first block; step 3 replaces this with stored-id resolution + the rebuild loop). The `import`/`sync`/`calendar` subcommands are unaffected (they use CLI flags via `conn.go`, not the config file).
- **Tests** (`internal/config/config_test.go`): migrated the `[server]`-based tests to `[[account]]`; added `TestLoadParsesMultipleAccounts`, `TestLoadRejectsLegacyServerSection`, `TestLoadRejectsNamelessAccount`, `TestLoadRejectsDuplicateAccountNames`, `TestLoadZeroAccountsIsOfflineNotError`, `TestFirstAccount`, `TestAccountID`. Each failed before the impl (verified RED), green after.
- **Docs deferred to step 5** (by the build plan): README Configuration/Usage + main.md Settled Decisions (Account model / Config schema) are rewritten in place once the whole feature is coherent, so they don't describe a switcher that doesn't exist yet.
- Full gate green: `go build ./...`, `go test ./...`, `go vet`, `staticcheck`, `gofmt`.
- Files: `internal/config/config.go`, `internal/config/template.go`, `internal/config/config_test.go`, `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — Design: v1.1.0 account switching detailed build plan

- Deep-dive design session for v1.1.0, all decisions owner-settled; main.md's goal-level v1.1.0 subsection replaced with the full design + 5 build steps.
- **Key decisions**: (1) **teardown & rebuild** switch — `ui.Run` returns quit-or-switch, the `cmd` loop reopens store/state/sync; hot-swap rejected (captured-pointer cross-account leak class). (2) **`[server]` deprecated outright** — `[[account]]` blocks (unique `name` + existing connection fields); old configs fail with a migration message; caches carry over (account-id derivation unchanged). (3) **Last-active account remembered** by account-id in a new global state file at the data-dir root; corrupt/missing → first block, never fatal. (4) **`:account <name>` + bare-`:account` picker modal**; status bar shows the active account when >1 configured. Plus `:config`-reload interplay (re-parses accounts, never yanks a live store) and failure modes (offline fallback, previous-account fallback on failed open).
- Grounding for the design: `runTUI` wiring read (single Store + sync closure into `ui.Run`; per-account state file already under each account's data dir; `:config` reload currently refuses account changes — the restriction v1.1.0 lifts).
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — Plan: v1.1.0 (account switching) + v1.2.0 (SELECT mode); delta sync indefinitely deferred

- Planned the next minor versions with the owner (goal-level now, per-version deep-dive before each implementation starts). Owner's original outline had v1.1.0 = sync tokens; a feasibility/perf check demoted it (below), shifting the versions up.
- **Delta-sync estimate (the demotion rationale)**: measured via a scratch benchmark (not committed) through the real `sync.Sync` + go-ical decode — 7.5 µs/event decode (850 B realistic event), 7.6 ms reconcile+store at n=10,000. Worst-case decade-scale calendar (~10k items) ≈ 0.5 s background client CPU on a Pi 5 (~3× derate) + ~12–15 MB transfer per full re-download, paid on the sync after each edit (stale-CTag rule) — acceptable, so `sync-collection`'s second server-trust surface isn't worth buying now. Also confirmed go-webdav's `SyncCollection` lives in its unimportable `internal/` package (a hand-rolled REPORT would be needed, precedent exists). Owner decision: **indefinitely deferred**; recorded in the Incremental-sync Settled Decision with the numbers and revisit triggers (metered link, slow server, ~40k-item response-cap ceiling).
- **`main.md` Build Plan**: new `### v1.1.0 — account switching (planned)` (multi-account `[[account]]` profiles, in-app `:account` switcher, strictly one active account, no merged view; deep-dive items listed) and `### v1.2.0 — SELECT mode (planned)` (vim-style multi-select — tree tasks / calendar days / drilled events; bulk complete/delete/yank/grab; mode-composition state space + `interactionMode` seam as the design core). Future-versions section now carries the consolidated candidate list (keybindings `[keys]`, persistent trash, conflict keep-both, detail-pane collapse, mouse click-to-select, deferred delta sync) — previously scattered across old log entries.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-21 — Docs: add the missing v1.0.2 subsection to main.md's Build Plan

- Session-startup doc sweep found one gap: the three 2026-07-20 fixes are labeled v1.0.2 in their commits and log entries, but the Build Plan had no `### v1.0.2` subsection — the version history ended at v1.0.1.
- Added `### v1.0.2 — bug fixes` between v1.0.1 and Future versions, summarizing the three fixes (month-grid multi-day label, week/day multi-day rendering, sync deferred while a form is open) with their regression-test guards, mirroring the v1.0.1 subsection's style.
- Verified the rest of the doc set is current: README and main.md already carry the ripples from all three fixes (Syncing bullet, Month/Week-day UI-Design paragraphs, Sync-triggers decision), `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md` is current through pass 17, `notes.md` is empty, and log.md headings = entries.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-20 — Fix (v1.0.2, Bug 2): debounced/periodic sync deferred while a create/edit form is open

- **Bug**: the debounced push a few seconds after a local edit often fired **while a create/edit form was still open**, silently discarding the user's typed input. Root cause: pushing the just-edited (Dirty) resource makes `CommitPush` store a **new** `*Resource` pointer; the open form captured the old `loc.Prev` pointer, so on Save the version-checked `PutIfUnchanged` sees `cur != loc.Prev`, reports the write **stale**, and `commitMutation`'s stale branch tears down the form (`closeModal`) — losing every keystroke. The `modalOpen()` predicate existed but the sync path never consulted it.
- **Fix** (gate the *timer-driven* triggers on `!modalOpen()`; the data-safety CAS is left untouched):
  - `internal/ui/sync.go`: extracted `fireDebouncedSync` — if a modal is open it re-arms (defers) instead of firing; the debounce `AfterFunc` now calls it. The periodic tick skips a tick while a modal is open.
  - `internal/ui/edit.go`: `closeModal` re-arms the debounced push when a modal is no longer open and `store.HasPendingChanges()`, so a deferred edit syncs promptly rather than waiting for the next periodic tick.
- **Deliberately unchanged**: `applyMutation`/`PutIfUnchanged` and the stale-CAS — the genuine concurrent-pull-clobber guard (`editclobber_test`) still passes. Manual `:sync`/`r` is unaffected (unreachable while a form holds focus). **Residual** (documented in main.md): a sync already *in flight* when the form opens can still land; the CAS then protects the data and the edit is skipped (not silently clobbered).
- **Repro-first**: `internal/ui/sync_modal_test.go` — `TestDebouncedSyncDefersWhileModalFormOpen` (fired-while-open → deferred/re-armed; fires after close) and `TestCloseModalRearmsDeferredPushWhenPending`. Both failed against a naive seam; green after the gate. Verified `TestApplyMutationDoesNotClobberConcurrentPull` and all existing sync tests still pass, incl. `-race`.
- **Docs**: main.md Sync-triggers decision records the defer-while-modal rule + residual; README Syncing bullet notes the debounced push is deferred while a form is open.
- Files: `internal/ui/sync.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/sync_modal_test.go`, `main.md`, `README.md`, `log.md`. Full gate green (build, `go test ./...`, vet, staticcheck, `-race`).

## 2026-07-20 — Fix (v1.0.2, Bug 1 week/day): multi-day timed event now renders on every day of its span

- **Bug**: in the week/day hourly time-grid a timed event spanning several days rendered **only on its start day** and vanished on the rest. Root cause: `splitOccs` bucketed a timed occurrence onto `DayStart(o.Start)` alone (the all-day branch beside it fanned across every covered day; the timed branch did not), and `drawBlock`/`hourFloat` were date-blind (time-of-day only), so a block could not span day columns.
- **Fix** (owner-approved: per-day clipped blocks): the event draws on every day it covers, clipped to each column — start day from its start time to the bottom (midnight), spanned-through days fill the whole column, final day from the top (midnight) to its end time.
  - `internal/model/calendar.go`: new `Occurrence.OverlapsDay(day)` (pure, reuses `overlaps`) — the day-membership test.
  - `internal/ui/render.go`: `splitOccs` timed branch now fans across `days` via `OverlapsDay` (mirrors the all-day branch, which is left untouched).
  - `internal/ui/timegridview.go`: `drawBlock` takes the column's `day` and computes date-aware geometry — top = start-time if it starts today else midnight; bottom = end-time if it ends today else bottom-of-day. The start-end time line is now only drawn for a single-day block (a multi-day segment conveys its bounds by where it meets the day edges).
- **Note**: the drill list (`dayItems`) already returned the full-span occurrence per day (the per-day store query's `baseInstance` uses `overlaps`), so drilling/selection needed no change — only the block bucketing and geometry did.
- **Repro-first**: `internal/ui/multiday_test.go` — `TestTimeGridRendersMultiDayTimedEventOnEveryDay` runs the real `splitOccs`→`setData`→`Draw` pipeline and asserts the event renders across ≥4 day columns (failed at 1 before the fix). Model guard: `TestOccurrenceOverlapsDay` in `internal/model/calendar_test.go`.
- **main.md**: documented the multi-day time-grid rendering in the Week/day UI-Design paragraph.
- Files: `internal/model/calendar.go`, `internal/model/calendar_test.go`, `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/timegridview.go`, `internal/ui/multiday_test.go`, `main.md`, `log.md`. Full gate green (build, `go test ./...`, vet, staticcheck).

## 2026-07-20 — Fix (v1.0.2, Bug 1 month): multi-day timed event no longer repeats its start time

- **Bug**: a timed event spanning several days (e.g. 11am 7/23 → 5pm 7/26) rendered its **start time on every day** of the span in the month grid. Root cause: `OccurrencesOn` returns the occurrence unclamped for each overlapping day and `DayAgenda` copied `o.Start` verbatim, so `itemLabel` printed `hourAxisLabel(it.Start.Hour())` identically on every cell — nothing distinguished a continuation day.
- **Fix** (owner-approved rendering): the **start day** shows the start time, the **final day** shows the end time prefixed `→` (e.g. `→5pm`), and the days it merely continues through show the **title alone**.
  - `internal/model/agenda.go`: added `End time.Time` to `AgendaItem` (zero for todos) and populated it from `o.End`, so a day-cell label can tell start/continuation/final day apart.
  - `internal/ui/calendarview.go`: `itemLabel` now takes the cell's `day` and branches on `model.SameDay(day, it.Start)` / `SameDay(day, it.End)`. A single-day timed event is unchanged (start day == final day → start time).
- **Repro-first**: `internal/ui/multiday_test.go` — `TestItemLabelMultiDayTimedEvent` (fails on the old body with "11am" on every day) + `TestItemLabelSingleDayTimedEventUnchanged` (regression guard for the common case).
- Threaded the new `day` arg through the one production caller (`drawCell`) and the one test caller (`taskcalendar_test.go`).
- **main.md**: documented the multi-day month-cell label behavior in the Month UI-Design paragraph.
- Files: `internal/model/agenda.go`, `internal/ui/calendarview.go`, `internal/ui/multiday_test.go`, `internal/ui/taskcalendar_test.go`, `main.md`, `log.md`. Full gate green (build, `go test ./...`, vet, staticcheck).

## 2026-07-20 — Build/CI: automate release binaries via GitHub Actions

- **Goal**: attach pre-built binaries to every GitHub Release, for all targets — Linux amd64, Raspberry Pi arm64/armv7/armv6, Windows amd64, macOS amd64/arm64 (owner decisions this session).
- **Trigger** (owner decision): `on: release: types: [published]` — the owner drafts the tag + release notes and clicks Publish; the workflow then builds and *attaches* assets. It never creates tags or releases itself (respects the versioning rule that the owner manages tags/releases).
- **Makefile** — reworked cross-builds into **one command per target**, with conventional `lazyplanner_<os>_<arch>` names (Windows gets `.exe`): `build-linux-amd64`, `build-linux-arm64`, `build-linux-armv7`, `build-linux-armv6`, `build-windows-amd64`, `build-darwin-amd64`, `build-darwin-arm64`. New `release` target builds all seven into `dist/` then writes `sha256sums.txt` (checksums run as `release`'s recipe, so it's correct under `make -j`); new `checksums` target regenerates the digest alone. The old Pi-only `pi-*` targets were folded into the new scheme, and `cross` now = the three linux/arm* builds (still the cheap ARM regression check `ci.yml` runs on every push). All cross-builds set `CGO_ENABLED=0` — verified the whole matrix compiles cgo-free from a Linux host, and `make release` locally produces correctly-typed, stripped, version-stamped binaries + checksums.
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** (new) — checkout with `fetch-depth: 0` (so the Makefile's `git describe` stamps the published tag into each binary), `setup-go` from `go.mod`, `make release`, then `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` uploads `dist/lazyplanner_*` + `sha256sums.txt`. `permissions: contents: write` (asset upload); `ci.yml` is untouched (still `contents: read`).
- **README** — Build and Install now leads with a **pre-built binaries** note (download from Releases, no build step) and documents `make release` + the per-target commands; the Raspberry Pi `make cross` output paths were updated to the new `lazyplanner_linux_{arm64,armv7,armv6}` names.
- **Not touched**: `main.md` (release/CI tooling isn't a program feature/version, so it stays out of the Build Plan). Full gate green via `make check`.
- Files: `Makefile`, `.github/workflows/release.yml` (new), `README.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-20 — Docs: nest the hardening passes under the v1.0.0 Build Plan header

- **Owner decision**: the hardening/audit passes were part of the v1.0.0 build, so they belong under the `### v1.0.0` header — just separated from the numbered build steps, not as a peer version subsection.
- Restructured `main.md`'s Build Plan: the 13 numbered steps now sit under a new `#### Build steps` subheading, and the former `### v1.0.x — hardening & audit (ongoing)` top-level subsection is demoted to `#### Hardening & audit (ongoing)` under v1.0.0. Content is byte-unchanged — heading level + placement only. Hierarchy is now `## Build Plan` → `### v1.0.0` → {`#### Build steps`, `#### Hardening & audit`}; `### v1.0.1` and `### Future versions` remain h3 peers.
- Ripple: the v1.0.1 subsection's cross-reference ("distinct from the v1.0.x hardening-pass ledger above") now reads "distinct from v1.0.0's hardening-pass ledger above", since v1.0.x is no longer a heading.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-20 — Fix (v1.0.1): a sync no longer resets the highlight in the tree/calendar

- **Bug**: a completed sync calls `refresh("")` (an empty `selUID`), and `refresh`'s task-tree branch reselected the current node only when `selUID != ""`; otherwise `buildTreeForList` fell to its default `SetCurrentNode(kids[0])`. So every sync — and with periodic/debounced sync, that's constantly — snapped the task-tree highlight back to the first task while you were reading/working further down. Reproduced with `TestSyncKeepsTreeHighlight` (fails: highlight jumps off the selected task after `refresh("")`).
- **Sibling bug (calendar)**: the same `refresh("")` path ran `buildCenterCalendar` → `setData`, which unconditionally resets `eventMode`/`eventIndex`, so a sync while **drilled into a day cycling its events** kicked the user back out to day navigation and reset to the first event. The drill-preserving `refreshKeepingDrill` already existed but is only used by direct mutations (e.g. `Space`), not by sync. Reproduced with `TestSyncKeepsCalendarDrill`.
- **Agenda checked — not affected**: the agenda center highlight is driven by `a.agendaList.GetCurrentItem()`, and that left-list index is already restored by `refresh` (`restoreListIndex`), so the position survives. Locked in as a regression guard (`TestSyncKeepsAgendaHighlight`).
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/edit.go`, `refresh`): when the caller passes no explicit `selUID`, preserve the current position across the rebuild — capture the current tree UID (new `currentTreeUID` helper) and reselect it in the Tasks branch; capture the calendar `drillState` and `reDrill` it in the Calendar branch (no `setFocus`, so a background sync can't steal focus from an open modal — that stays `refreshKeepingDrill`'s job for the mutation path). An explicit `selUID` (a mutation that knows what to reselect) still wins. Strictly improves the other `refresh("")` callers too (conflict resolution, calendar visibility toggle).
- **Files**: `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/synchighlight_test.go` (new). Full gate green (build, `go test ./...`, `-race` on the new tests, vet, staticcheck).

## 2026-07-20 — Docs: add Versioning section to CLAUDE.md (backfill log entry)

- Backfills the missing `log.md` entry for owner commit `8905cbb`, which added a **Versioning** section to CLAUDE.md (between "The Documents"/`examples` and "Git Branching Rules"). The commit itself carried no log entry; this records it.
- The section documents the project's vX.X.X convention: **major** `vX.0.0` (multiple large features, breaking changes, or major refactoring), **intermediate/minor** `v0.X.0` (a single large feature, moderate refactoring, or a large group of bug fixes), **hotfix** `v0.0.X` (targeted bug fixes only). It also codifies that GitHub tags/releases are the version source of truth, that Claude never edits/adds tags without explicit permission, and that the owner defines the working version.
- This is a HOW change (a new rule for the way of working), so CLAUDE.md is the correct home — no `main.md`/README ripple.
- Files: `log.md` (the CLAUDE.md edit landed in `8905cbb`).

## 2026-07-19 — Docs: fix Raspberry Pi capitalization (README + CLAUDE.md charter)

- Owner decision: use the conventional "Raspberry Pi", not the charter's literal "Raspberry PI".
- Fixed the README subsection heading (`### Raspberry Pi`), its link text in the Build and Install lead, and the CLAUDE.md README-charter line. The `#raspberry-pi` anchor is unchanged, so no links needed updating.

## 2026-07-19 — Docs: restructure README to the new CLAUDE.md section charter

- Reordered the README to match the section structure the owner added to CLAUDE.md (commit `ae17602`): What it does → Configuration → Usage (Managing Calendars, Keybindings) → Syncing → Build and Install (Linux / Windows / Raspberry PI) → Development → License. Pure moves — no user-facing content was dropped (word count +19 from lead-ins only).
- **Build & Install** (was section 2) moved after Syncing, renamed "Build and Install", and split into `### Linux` / `### Windows` / `### Raspberry PI` subsections; the former top-level "Raspberry Pi / dedicated terminal" section (cross-compile, kiosk autologin, performance notes) folded in as the Raspberry PI subsection.
- **Managing calendars** (was a top-level section after Syncing) became `### Managing Calendars` under Usage, before `### Keybindings`; its "flags same as `import`" reference now forward-links to Syncing.
- Ripple fixes: `#raspberry-pi--dedicated-terminal` anchor → `#raspberry-pi`, "see Configuration below" → "above", heading case (`Managing Calendars`, `Build and Install`).
- Light general-style pass per the new all-documents rules: the two densest Usage paragraphs ("Creating & editing", "Commands & layout") broken into a lead sentence + bullets; no key narration added.
- Verified: all 6 internal anchors resolve against the new headings; section order matches the charter exactly.
- Files: `README.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-18 — Docs: final pre-1.0 sweep — two precision fixes (timezone overstatement, create-prefix)

- Ran a final documentation sweep with three parallel review agents (cross-doc consistency/references, log.md integrity, README+main.md vs code). log.md integrity passed clean (248 headings = 248 entries, ordering + this-session claims verified); most areas clean. Two real precision fixes surfaced (the timezone one flagged independently by two agents):
- **main.md:146 (timezone overstatement, grazed the iron rule)**: the UI-Design line said "All timed values are stored in UTC", which the earlier line-364 reconcile left contradicting the iron rule — an *imported* server value carrying a TZID is preserved untouched, not re-stored in UTC; only values LazyPlanner *writes* are UTC. Narrowed to "displayed in the local timezone; ones LazyPlanner writes are stored in UTC (a value imported from the server is preserved as-is per the iron rule)".
- **README create-prefix (over-generalization)**: "the object letter … and its capital opens the full form" implied `c`/`l` have capital/quick-add variants; they don't (only `t`/`e`/`s` do, per `internal/ui/keys.go`). Scoped it to "a capital `T`/`E`/`S` … (calendars and lists always open their form)".
- Verified-clean by the agents (no change needed): version-field removal, README version/build claims vs the Makefile+main.go, all markdown anchors + screenshot paths, the `Spec_Examples` rename (no live lowercase refs), the trimmed Usage/Syncing prose vs code, the timezone Settled Decision vs `internal/model/edit.go`, defaults, charters, empty notes.md. CLAUDE.md guardrails' audit-pass citations were flagged borderline but kept (load-bearing "why" for the recurring-class guardrails).
- Files: `main.md`, `README.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix: reconcile the examples/Spec_Examples dir-name inconsistency

- The `examples/spec_examples/` → `examples/Spec_Examples/` rename was already on disk (predating this session) and got **unintentionally swept into the screenshot commit `fcd2006`** by a `git add -A` — a process slip (the `R` rename line in `git status` should have been caught pre-commit). The result was an inconsistency: CLAUDE.md documented the lowercase name while disk/git carried the capitalized one.
- **Owner decision**: keep `Spec_Examples` (consistent with the Capitalized_Snake `README_Photos` dir). Updated CLAUDE.md's reference (`### examples/Spec_Examples/`) so the doc matches disk.
- The one remaining lowercase mention (`log.md`) is inside a prior history entry and is left byte-intact per the log-immutability rule (it recorded the state accurately at the time).
- Process note: prefer explicit `git add <paths>` over `git add -A` so an unrelated working-tree change can't ride along in a commit.
- Files: `CLAUDE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-18 — Docs: add README screenshots (owner-supplied)

- Added the two owner-supplied screenshots (`examples/README_Photos/{Calendar_View,Task_View}.png`, ~66 KB each) to the README — the visual the earlier review flagged as the single highest-impact improvement for a TUI project.
- **Calendar view** placed as the hero right under the tagline (shows the full three-region layout: overview column with truecolor calendar dots, the month grid, the detail pane, and the `NORMAL` mode badge). **Task view** placed after the feature list with a one-line caption, showcasing the centerpiece deep-subtask tree.
- Centered via `<p align="center">` with descriptive `alt` text on each `<img>` (accessibility); `width="900"` keeps them from overflowing. Images committed to the repo (small PNGs, not gitignored).
- Files: `README.md`, `log.md`, + the two committed PNGs.

## 2026-07-18 — Docs: trim README wordiness + codify a README conciseness rule in CLAUDE.md

- **README (conciseness pass on the three wordiest spots identified in review):**
  - **Usage prose ↔ keybindings-table duplication**: the Usage prose narrated nearly every key that the keybindings table (kept as-is) already lists. Collapsed the prose to **orientation only** — the pane model, drilling/2D nav, the subtask tree + zoom, folders, grab mode, the `i`-prefix + quick-add tokens + type-locking, the recurring scope picker, the mode badge, two-way color sync — and deleted the key-by-key narration the table carries. Added a lead line pointing to the table as the canonical key reference. No user-facing concept was dropped; the section is roughly halved.
  - **The line-46 Calendars blob** (one ~250-word run-on) and the every-sync-trigger sentence in Syncing were both broken into a lead sentence + a scannable bullet list.
  - Dropped a duplicated `r`/background-sync bullet from Usage (it belongs in Syncing) and a filler closing sentence in Recurring.
- **CLAUDE.md (rule change — a HOW change, permitted)**: added two conciseness rules to the README charter so this drift is caught next time — (1) the keybindings table is the canonical key reference and prose must not re-narrate it (prose covers only concepts a key list can't); (2) prefer short sentences + bullet lists over long parenthetical-laden run-ons, with "update the table row first" guidance.
- Files: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-18 — Build: inject version from the git tag (no hardcoded version in source)

- **Follow-through on the "GitHub releases own the version" decision**: the binary reported a hardcoded `appVersion = "0.0.1"` const, which would need hand-bumping every release — the same maintained-version problem, one file over.
- **Code** (`cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`): split the identity block — `appName` stays a const; `appVersion` is now a package `var` defaulting to `"dev"`, injectable at link time via `-ldflags "-X main.appVersion=..."`. Documented why it must be a var (only `-X`-settable form) and that it is set once at link time, never mutated at runtime, so it is not the banned global mutable state. Extracted `versionString()` as a testable seam and routed both the `version` subcommand and the UI title through it.
- **Build** (`Makefile`): new `VERSION := git describe --tags --always --dirty` (falls back to `dev` without git) injected via `VERSION_LDFLAGS` into both `build` and the `cross`/Pi targets, so a tagged build reports its tag (`v1.0.0`), an untagged commit its short hash, and a plain `go build` stays `dev`.
- **Test** (`cmd/lazyplanner/main_test.go`): `TestVersionStringSurfacesInjectedVersion` guards that `version` output includes the `appVersion` var, so an injected tag flows through (a regression that stopped using the var would be caught).
- **Verified end-to-end**: plain `go build` → `LazyPlanner dev`; git-describe ldflags → `LazyPlanner a4bb443-dirty` (would be `v1.0.0` on a clean tagged checkout); explicit `-X main.appVersion=v1.0.0` → `LazyPlanner v1.0.0`. (`make` isn't installed in this env, so the exact `make build` command line was simulated.)
- **README**: noted that `make build`/`make cross` stamp the version from the git tag while plain `go build` leaves it `dev`.
- Files: `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `cmd/lazyplanner/main_test.go`, `Makefile`, `README.md`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Docs: main.md no longer tracks a release version (GitHub releases own it)

- **Owner decision**: main.md must not carry a maintained release-version number — GitHub Releases + git tags are the source of truth for versions.
- Removed the `Version: 1.0.0, plus ongoing v1.0.x hardening` field from Project Identity and replaced it with a **Releases** pointer that codifies the decision: versions live on GitHub; main.md tracks the design and the Build Plan (planning milestones), never a maintained release version.
- Left intact (not release-version tracking): the Build Plan's `### v1.0.0` / `### v1.0.x` section headings (the "versioned Build Plan" is main.md's sanctioned role — planning history) and Current State's phase description.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-18 — Docs: 1.0 release review — reconcile main.md timezone decision, trim transient state, README :calendar new

- Pre-1.0 document-charter review (two parallel review agents cross-checked README-vs-code and main.md internal consistency; findings verified against the code before acting).
- **main.md Finding 1.1 (real — superseded decision left standing)**: the Timezones settled-decision (Settled Decisions) said "store what the server has; create new items in the local timezone", contradicting the UI Design section's "timed values are stored in UTC … written as the equivalent UTC instant". The code (`internal/model/edit.go` `newDateOrTimeProp` → `prop.SetDateTime(t.UTC())`) implements the UTC model, so the settled-decision phrasing was the stale one. Rewrote it **in place** to match: preserve the server's bytes untouched on ingest (iron rule), write newly created/edited *timed* values in UTC (Z form) entered as local wall-clock, display local, all-day date-only.
- **main.md Finding 2.1 (transient state in a permanent doc)**: Current State carried a churny operational note (test server "back online since 2026-07-18; credentials being rotated; live suite must be re-pointed"). This is neither settled design nor a mid-arc task (so it belongs in neither main.md nor `notes.md`) — trimmed to the stable fact: findings are verified headlessly, the opt-in live suite runs against a throwaway test account on demand.
- **README completeness**: added `:calendar new` to the `:calendar` command list — the code's help string and main.md both list `new|rename|color|hide|show`; the README was the outlier.
- Reviewed but deliberately left as-is: Build Plan step 8's "black/white dialogs" (permitted Build-Plan history, superseded by the terminal-default-background design); the "tasks with children" folder metaphor in the data-model note; the README "Development" pointer section (within charter — points, carries no history). CLAUDE.md, log.md structure, notes.md (empty), and the audit docs were verified in-charter and current.
- **Release note (not a doc fix)**: `appVersion` in `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go` is still `0.0.1` — a code bump for the release proper, flagged for the owner, out of scope for this doc review.
- Files: `main.md`, `README.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-18 — Docs: finalize Pass 17 (ledger, pass report, build plan, twin-boundary testing guardrail)

- **PROTOCOL.md**: added a **test-net guardrail — boundaries and sibling-guard parity** (codified per rule 9 after passes 14 + 17 escaped *twin* canaries — the pass-17 `DayAgenda` upper-bound escape mirrored the pass-14 lower-bound escape on the same function, and `reconcileReadOnly`'s degraded-download escape mirrored a guard already covered on the read-write path). Two rules: test *both* sides of every half-open window; mirror a guard's canary onto every sibling path. This recurring class is a *testing* practice, so it lands in the audit protocol rather than CLAUDE.md's code-focused Hard-won guardrails.
- **COVERAGE.md**: flipped both pass-17 MED rows (Timezone/DST, Import ingest) UNFIXED→FIXED; flipped the two canary-hole notes (subtask-tree COUNT-clamp, state-file Load) to CLOSED; updated the feature-promise row (the VALUE=PERIOD-IANA gap is now fixed); rewrote the blind-spots entries for both MED and the four canaries to RESOLVED/CLOSED; retitled the pass-17 canary section "4 of 4 escaped → all CLOSED" with each OPEN→CLOSED and its guard test named.
- **PASS-17.md**: status line → ALL RESOLVED (both MED fixed, all four canaries closed), body kept as as-found evidence; recorded the two fix-time corrections (the COUNT-clamp boundary triggers *past* the last occurrence, and the state.Load canary needed a later-field type mismatch since the suggested trailing-garbage repro is rejected by `checkValid` pre-decode).
- **main.md**: added the Pass 17 Build Plan line and rewrote the convergence scorecard — HIGH 2→0 (first HIGH-free re-sweep; criterion 2 now at one of two), no new root-cause class, but all four canaries escaped (worst on record, two twins); est. ~1 more re-sweep to earn the streak, sync-core TOCTOU the main heavier surface left.
- Files: `docs/audit/PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`, `docs/audit/passes/PASS-17.md`, `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-18 — Test (Pass 17 canary): guard state.Load's json.Unmarshal error check

- **Canary escape** (test-net hole, code correct): dropping `state.Load`'s `json.Unmarshal` error check passed the suite. The only malformed-input test (`TestLoadBadFileIsZero`, `"{ not json"`) fails Unmarshal *before* it mutates the struct, so `s` stays zero whether or not the error is checked.
- **Corrected the suggested repro**: the canary's suggested "trailing garbage after a valid object" repro would *also* have escaped — `json.Unmarshal` runs `checkValid` over the whole input first, so trailing garbage is rejected before any decode and leaves the struct zero (verified empirically). The case that actually requires the error check is a **type mismatch on a later field** (`{"left_width":5,"hidden_calendars":123}`): `checkValid` passes, the decoder populates `left_width`, then records the type error — leaving a half-populated struct that the dropped check would surface.
- **Guard**: `TestLoadPartialParseThenErrorIsZero` in `internal/state/state_test.go` — asserts Load returns a zero State for that input. Adversarially verified: dropping the check makes it fail (`{LeftWidth:5}` leaks); reverting restores green. `state.go` unchanged.
- Files: `internal/state/state_test.go`. Full gate green. **All four Pass-17 canary holes now closed.**

## 2026-07-18 — Test (Pass 17 canary): pin DayAgenda's due-window upper bound (twin of the pass-14 lower bound)

- **Canary escape** (test-net hole, code correct): flipping `DayAgenda`'s upper bound `t.Due.Before(dayEnd)` → `!t.Due.After(dayEnd)` (exclusive → inclusive) passed the suite. The window is half-open `[dayStart, dayEnd)`; a todo due exactly at `dayEnd` (00:00 of the next day — the natural due time for a date-only todo) belongs to the *next* day, so an inclusive upper bound would duplicate it onto both days. This is the **upper-bound twin of the pass-14 lower-bound escape** — `TestDayAgendaIncludesTodoDueAtMidnight` pins the inclusive lower bound but nothing asserted the exclusive upper bound.
- **Guard**: `TestDayAgendaExcludesTodoDueAtDayEnd` in `internal/model/agenda_test.go` — a todo due exactly at `dayEnd` must yield 0 items. Adversarially verified: the mutation returns 1 item (the next-day task leaking in); reverting restores green. `agenda.go` unchanged.
- **Recurring twin-boundary pattern** noted for the guardrail step (pass-14 + pass-17 both escaped the same function's opposite boundary).
- Files: `internal/model/agenda_test.go`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Test (Pass 17 canary): guard NewSeriesFrom's future-COUNT clamp against unbounded collapse

- **Canary escape** (test-net hole, code correct): weakening `NewSeriesFrom`'s clamp `if remaining < 1 { remaining = 1 }` → `< 0` passed the model suite. When a this-and-future split lands at/after the final occurrence, `pastCount == COUNT` so `remaining` computes to 0; the clamp forces 1, but `< 0` lets 0 through and rrule-go treats `COUNT=0` as *unbounded* — the future series would recur forever. The existing split tests (`recur_split_{exdate,rdate}_test.go`) only cover pre-split EXDATE/RDATE COUNT preservation; none splits at the series end where `remaining` hits 0.
- **Boundary confirmed empirically first**: `rruleIterationsBefore` counts iterations *strictly before* occ, so `remaining==0` requires occ *past* the last occurrence (splitting exactly at the last gives `remaining==1`, no clamp). The past-the-end split legitimately creates the future series' own new occurrence at occ, so the guard asserts **boundedness** (future has exactly 1 occurrence), not sum-to-original.
- **Guard**: `internal/model/recur_split_count_test.go` (`TestSplitAtSeriesEndKeepsFutureBounded`) — FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=3, split at day+1-past-end; asserts the future series yields exactly one occurrence at the split point (not 176 under the mutation) and the capped half keeps all three. Adversarially verified: the mutation makes it fail (unbounded, 176 occurrences); reverting restores green. `recur_edit.go` unchanged.
- Files: `internal/model/recur_split_count_test.go`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Test (Pass 17 canary): guard reconcileReadOnly's degraded-download branch

- **Canary escape** (test-net hole, code correct): inverting `reconcileReadOnly`'s degraded-download guard (`case !onServer && unfetched[r.Href]:` → `!unfetched`) passed the whole suite. The read-*write* twin of this guard is covered (`degraded_download_deletion_test.go`), but the read-only path's equivalent had no test combining a read-only calendar with a degraded/partial download — the only read-only test uses a dirty-stuck resource (Discard) and a new-on-server resource (pull), never a previously-synced clean read-only resource that is server-deleted or unfetched. A regression would false-delete a still-present read-only resource whose GET merely failed, or leak a genuine server deletion.
- **Guard**: `internal/sync/readonly_degraded_download_test.go` (`TestReadOnlyDegradedDownloadKeptVsDeleted`) exercises both sides at once on a read-only calendar — an unfetched (GET-failed) resource still on the server must be KEPT; a genuinely server-absent one must be Forgotten (`PulledDeletes==1`). Adversarially verified: inverting the guard at the reconcileReadOnly site (sync.go:514, distinct from the read-write site at 396) makes both assertions fail; reverting restores green. `sync.go` unchanged.
- Files: `internal/sync/readonly_degraded_download_test.go`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 17 MED, import): empty-href objects no longer silently overwrite each other on Import

- **Bug**: the Import object loop (`import.go`) wrote every downloaded object without checking for an empty resource `Path`, unlike its sibling `reconcileCalendar` (sync.go), which skips empty-href objects via `errEmptyHref`. A malformed/hostile CalDAV server can return responses with empty `<href/>` elements (go-webdav's `Response.Path()` returns `("", nil)` for a 200 propstat with an empty href), so `DownloadAll` yields `caldav.Object`s with `Path==""`. Import fed these to `resourceFileName("")` → the placeholder name `resource.ics`, so multiple empty-href objects all collided on that one name in `PullRemoteBatch` and silently overwrote each other — each clean (no `ErrKeptLocalEdit`), yet each overwrite counted as a successful pull. Import reported N imported while storing 1; the lost object was never recovered (next sync leaves the local `resource.ics` an inert href-less pull-orphan). Silent item-level data loss under a success report.
- **Fix**: mirror `reconcileCalendar`'s guard — skip `obj.Path==""` in the import loop and record it in `res.Skipped` with `errEmptyHref` instead of adding it to `pulls`. (The same-basename collision for two *distinct* non-empty hrefs is a separate theoretical case; empty-href is the concretely reachable trigger and is what the sibling path guards.)
- **Repro-first**: `internal/sync/import_emptyhref_test.go` (`TestImportEmptyHrefNotSilentlyLost`) — two distinct empty-href objects previously gave `res.Objects=2` with 1 stored and 0 skips; now both are skipped (`res.Objects=0`, 2 skips, 0 stored), and the test asserts the reported count never exceeds what is persisted.
- Files: `internal/sync/import.go`, `internal/sync/import_emptyhref_test.go`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 17 MED, tz): IANA-TZID VALUE=PERIOD RDATE no longer mis-zoned to floating

- **Bug**: `resolveDateTimeValues` set a period element's sub-prop `Value` to `periodStart(part)` but left the stale `VALUE=PERIOD` param on the (shallow-copied) sub-prop. go-ical's `prop.DateTime` has no period case and rejects it, so the value fell into `resolveDateTime`'s recovery path — which only mapped **Windows** zone names (`windowsToIANA`) and never `LoadLocation`'d an IANA TZID directly. An `RDATE;VALUE=PERIOD` with a real IANA TZID (Google/Outlook-style) thus dropped to the floating fallback and was zoned in the calendar's fallback `loc`, not its TZID — a wrong absolute occurrence, silently, while the Windows-name spelling of the same zone resolved correctly (the two paths disagreed).
- **Fix** (two parts, per the finding): (1) in `resolveDateTimeValues`, once `periodStart` has reduced the value to a plain date-time, drop the now-stale `VALUE=PERIOD` param — cloning the params first (`cloneParams`) since the shallow struct copy shares the original's map, so the original prop is never mutated; (2) add an IANA-TZID recovery branch to `resolveDateTime` (`else if z, err := time.LoadLocation(tzid)`), parallel to the Windows-name branch, so a TZID go-ical rejected for a non-zone reason is still zoned by its TZID rather than dropped to floating.
- **Repro-first**: the workflow's `rdate_period_tzid_repro_test.go` (RED in the tree) was promoted to the permanent regression test `internal/model/rdate_period_tzid_test.go` — now a table asserting the IANA and Windows spellings agree (`TestRDatePeriodTZIDZoned`) plus a direct guard on the recovery branch (`TestResolveDateTimeIANATZIDRecovery`). Adversarially verified: both fail with either fix hunk neutered, pass with them restored.
- Files: `internal/model/tz.go`, `internal/model/rdate_period_tzid_test.go`. Full gate (test + vet + staticcheck + build) green.

## 2026-07-18 — Docs: finalize Pass 16 (ledger, pass report, build plan, encoder-heal guardrail)

- **Guardrail (rule 9 — recurring class)**: the decode-but-unencodable encoder-heal class reopened (pass 10 → 16), so updated CLAUDE.md's malformed-iCalendar guardrail: it now names `healComponentConstraints`/`dropUnusableTimezones`, records the owner-approved drop-an-unusable-component exception to the iron rule, and — the key addition — mandates that the heal set **mirror go-ical's full `encoder.go` validateComponent** (exactlyOne/atMostOne per component + `singleValuedProps`), re-diffed whenever a new component type is ingested or go-ical bumps, so the class can't reopen a third time.
- **COVERAGE.md**: flipped the four pass-16 rows (encoder, CLI wiring, mouse, `:config`) to fixed; closed both pass-16 canaries (OPEN→CLOSED); replaced the "healer component-incomplete" and "mouse/:config UNFIXED" blind-spots with the resolved state + the new center-agenda-board click-select follow-up.
- **PASS-16.md**: status line → all 6 fixed + both canaries closed (body kept as as-found evidence).
- **main.md**: added the Pass 16 Build Plan line and rewrote the convergence scorecard — HIGH 2→2 (streak still zero), criterion 1 (matrix covered once) now effectively met but "covered once ≠ closed" when a prior closure was incomplete; corrected the stale "childless VTIMEZONE not auto-healed" accepted-gap (now stripped); est. ~1–2 re-sweep passes to earn a clean no-HIGH streak.
- Three pre-session leftover repro files (helpflag/malformedvtimezone/repro_vjournal) were promoted to permanent regression tests as part of their fixes.
- Files: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`, `docs/audit/passes/PASS-16.md`, `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 16 HIGH, VTIMEZONE): strip an unencodable VTIMEZONE on ingest

- **Bug** (the other half of the reopened decode-but-unencodable class): a VTIMEZONE missing TZID, or whose STANDARD/DAYLIGHT omits a required DTSTART/TZOFFSETTO/TZOFFSETFROM, decodes but fails `Encode()`, bricking the whole resource (incl. a valid sibling VEVENT) on the first edit. Distinct from the already-accepted "childless VTIMEZONE" gap (these have children, but incomplete ones).
- **Owner decision**: strip the unusable VTIMEZONE (over best-effort heal or accept-residual) — precedent-aligned with the existing empty-VTIMEZONE drop, and an unencodable VTIMEZONE carries no usable offset anyway.
- **Fix**: broadened `dropEmptyTimezones` → `dropUnusableTimezones`, which drops a VTIMEZONE that is empty, lacks TZID, or has a STANDARD/DAYLIGHT missing a required prop (new `timezoneUsable` predicate; runs after `dedupeSingleValued` so a duplicate isn't mistaken for a missing prop). A referenced TZID that no longer resolves degrades to floating time via `resolveDateTime` (the app's existing fallback), so nothing usable is lost. Iron-rule trade-off: one corrupt, unusable component is dropped to keep the resource — and its valid events — writable.
- **Repro-first**: `internal/model/malformed_vtimezone_test.go` (`TestMalformedVTimezoneDroppedKeepsResourceWritable`) — all three malformed cases now re-encode with the VEVENT intact; the existing `TestEmptyVTimezoneBlocksEncode` still passes.
- Files: `internal/model/decode.go`, `internal/model/malformed_vtimezone_test.go`. Full gate green. This closes both Pass 16 HIGH findings.

## 2026-07-18 — Test (Pass 16 canaries): guard Configured() partial-config + connFlags.client() credentials

- **2 canary escapes** (test-coverage holes, code correct): (1) `config.Server.Configured()` (`URL != "" && Username != ""`) had no test asserting a partial (URL-only/username-only) config returns false — flipping `&&`→`||` passed the suite, so a partial connection would read as configured and be synced against. (2) `connFlags.client()`'s credential guard (`url=="" || username=="" || password==""`) was wholly untested — `conn.go`/`import.go`/`sync.go`/`calendar.go` had no direct tests — so flipping `||`→`&&` (build a client with an empty password) passed.
- **Guards**: `TestServerConfigured` (table: both/url-only/username-only/neither) and new `cmd/lazyplanner/conn_test.go` `TestConnFlagsClientRequiresAllCredentials` (all-present builds a client; any field missing errors). Adversarially verified — each fails under its exact mutation and passes after reverting. No production code changed.
- Files: `internal/config/config_test.go`, `cmd/lazyplanner/conn_test.go`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 16 LOW #6): double-click edits the row under the cursor

- **Bug**: `mouseCapture`'s `MouseLeftDoubleClick` branch called `editSelected()` — which reads the *current* selection — before tview processed the event. If the two clicks of a double-click landed on different rows (pointer moved within the interval), the edit form opened for the previously-selected row, not the row clicked. Recoverable (form only).
- **Fix**: new `treeNodeAtY` maps the click's screen row to the visible task-tree node using public tview APIs only (visible index = y − innerTop + scrollOffset over a pre-order walk of expanded nodes, root included — mirroring TreeView's own mouse math without reaching into its unexported node slice). The double-click handler `SetCurrentNode`s that node before editing. `SetCurrentNode` only sets the field, so the tree's expand-toggle `SetSelectedFunc` does **not** fire (routing a synthetic click would have toggled expansion).
- **Scope note**: the center agenda board has no click-to-select mapping even for single clicks, so a double-click there still edits the current agenda selection — recorded as a known limitation in `COVERAGE.md` (board-level hit-testing is a separate follow-up).
- **Repro-first**: `internal/ui/dblclick_test.go` (`TestDoubleClickEditsRowUnderCursor`) — a double-click on row B with row A selected opened A's form; now opens B's.
- Files: `internal/ui/mouse.go`, `internal/ui/dblclick_test.go`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 16 MED #4 + LOW #5): subcommand flag-parse output (one shared fix)

- **Bug** (shared root cause): every subcommand ran `fs.Parse(args); return err` with `flag.ContinueOnError`. `flag` already writes output for two cases, so returning the error straight to `report()` double-handled it: (MED) `-h/--help` returns `flag.ErrHelp` after fs.Parse prints usage → `report()` printed a spurious `lazyplanner: flag: help requested` and exited **1**; (LOW) a bad flag has its error+usage printed by fs.Parse, then `report()` printed the **same error again**.
- **Fix**: a shared `parseFlags(fs, args)` helper returns `flag.ErrHelp` unchanged and tags any other parse error `errFlagParsed`; `report()` now maps `ErrHelp`→exit 0 (usage already shown) and `errFlagParsed`→exit 2 without re-printing (flag already printed). All five subcommand parse sites (import/sync/calendar list-create-delete) route through it.
- **Repro-first**: `cmd/lazyplanner/subcommand_flags_test.go` (`TestSubcommandHelpFlagExitsZero`) and `subcommand_badflag_test.go` (`TestSubcommandBadFlagPrintsErrorOnce`).
- Files: `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `import.go`, `sync.go`, `calendar.go`, + the two tests. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 16 MED #3): :config reload surfaces config.Load's warning

- **Bug**: `editConfigFn`'s reload path read `cfg, _, _, err := config.Load()`, discarding Load's warning. Only `buildSyncFn`'s warning reached `ui.ConfigReload.Warning`, so an appearance typo (`default_view="wek"`) or a **world-readable password file** introduced in the editor was silently accepted on reload — the reload flashed "config reloaded" with no warning, whereas a startup Load of the same file surfaces one (mildly security-relevant for the permission case).
- **Fix**: capture Load's warning and combine it with buildSyncFn's via a new `joinWarnings` helper (startup emits them as separate stderr lines; the UI reload flash is a single string, so they're joined with "; ").
- **Repro-first**: `cmd/lazyplanner/configreload_warning_test.go` (`TestConfigReloadPreservesLoadWarning`) — with a 0644 config carrying a typo, `ConfigReload.Warning` was empty; now non-empty.
- Files: `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `cmd/lazyplanner/configreload_warning_test.go`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 16 HIGH, safe part): heal VJOURNAL/VFREEBUSY encode constraints

- **Bug** (part of the reopened decode-but-unencodable class): a foreign resource carrying a **VJOURNAL/VFREEBUSY** that omits DTSTAMP, or carries a duplicate single-valued property, decodes but fails `Encode()` — go-ical's encoder requires exactly-one {DTSTAMP, UID} and at-most-one for a list of props on these components, and the ingest healers covered only VEVENT/VTODO/VTIMEZONE. The whole resource (incl. a valid sibling VEVENT) became unwritable on the first edit.
- **Fix** (add-only, no fabricated semantics): added VJOURNAL and VFREEBUSY entries to `singleValuedProps` (so `dedupeSingleValued` drops encode-blocking duplicates on them), and `healComponentConstraints` now DTSTAMP-heals VJOURNAL/VFREEBUSY the same way `Parse` does VEVENT/VTODO. A **missing UID** on these components is still not healed (fabricating one would churn sync identity — the settled decision / pass-15 residual) and is part of the separate heal-vs-accept decision, together with the malformed-VTIMEZONE HIGH.
- **Repro-first**: `internal/model/vjournal_encode_test.go` (`TestHealVJournalMissingDTSTAMP`, `TestHealVJournalDuplicateSingleValued`, `TestHealVFreeBusyMissingDTSTAMP`) — each previously failed `Encode()`, now green.
- Files: `internal/model/decode.go`, `internal/model/vjournal_encode_test.go`. Full gate (test + vet + staticcheck) green.

## 2026-07-18 — Audit: Pass 16 (mouse / :config, plus opportunistic encoder + CLI sweeps)

- Ran the `hardening-audit` workflow targeting the last stale headless cells (mouse handling input-edge; `:config`/`$EDITOR` reload fault-injection). The run hit the session usage limit mid-canary/synthesis; **resumed** after reset (`resumeFromRunId`) — completed audit/verify agents replayed from cache, canaries + synthesis re-ran, `enforcement.valid: true`. The plan swept broader than the two targets (also go-ical encoder fuzz, CLI wiring, CTag, background-sync goroutines).
- **6 confirmed findings, all repros verified red** (HIGH 2 · MED 2 · LOW 2): (HIGH) a malformed **VTIMEZONE** (missing TZID, or STANDARD/DAYLIGHT missing DTSTART/TZOFFSETTO/TZOFFSETFROM) and (HIGH) a **VJOURNAL/VFREEBUSY** missing DTSTAMP or with duplicate single-valued props both decode but fail `Encode()`, bricking the whole resource — the **same decode-but-unencodable class Pass 10 declared closed**, now shown component-incomplete; (MED) `:config` reload discards `config.Load`'s warning (typo + world-readable-password lost); (MED) subcommand `-h/--help` exits non-zero with a spurious error line; (LOW) a bad subcommand flag prints twice; (LOW) double-click edits the previously-selected row. **2 canaries escaped** (`Server.Configured()` partial-config; the whole `connFlags.client()` credential path untested).
- **Convergence**: HIGH held at 2 (no-HIGH streak stays broken), total 3→6; not converged, and the reopened encoder-heal class implicates criterion 3. Three of the six repro files (helpflag, malformedvtimezone, repro_vjournal) predated this session as untracked leftovers — long-standing, previously-found-but-never-fixed.
- Removed the 4 leaked canary worktrees. Owner direction: heal the safe HIGH parts (VJOURNAL DTSTAMP/dedupe) + fix all MED/LOW + add the 2 canary guards, repro-first; bring the un-healable HIGH parts (VTIMEZONE TZID/offsets) as a separate heal-vs-accept decision.
- Files: `docs/audit/passes/PASS-16.md` (new). Fixes land in following repro-first commits; `COVERAGE.md` finalized with them.

## 2026-07-18 — Docs: CLAUDE.md Session Startup wording + summary step

- Committed a pre-existing uncommitted CLAUDE.md edit (present at session start, not part of the audit work): retitled the Session Startup list from "Before starting any task" to "When reading this file for the first time", and added step 5 — give the user a short summary of the most recently completed task and the recommended next steps. Fixed the "reccomended" typo in the same increment. A legitimate HOW change (how a session opens).
- Files: `CLAUDE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-18 — Docs: finalize Pass 15 (ledger, pass report, build plan, MED accepted residual)

- **Owner decision**: MED #3 (import drops a valid sibling of a UID-less component) is accepted as a **documented residual**, not fixed — every fix crosses a hard invariant (fabricate-UID reverses the settled no-fabricate decision; per-component encode weakens the iron rule; the CalDAV transport hands us an already-decoded `*ical.Calendar`, so no raw bytes survive to preserve), and it's reachable only from a malformed foreign/hand-edited `.ics` with the loss surfaced in `res.Skipped`.
- **Guardrail check**: the two HIGH share no coding-*practice* root cause (one is HTTP-client redirect policy, one is a load-time filename heuristic) — no new Hard-won guardrail warranted (each is guarded by its regression test). Recorded per the protocol's convergence-record rule.
- **COVERAGE.md**: flipped the CalDAV response-parse and store-filesystem rows from HIGH-UNFIXED to fixed; marked the import row an accepted residual; closed the pass-15 `ListObjectHrefs` canary (OPEN→CLOSED); added the import MED to the accepted-gaps list.
- **PASS-15.md**: status line updated (both HIGH fixed, canary closed, MED accepted residual), body kept as as-found evidence.
- **main.md**: added the Pass 15 Build Plan line and rewrote the convergence scorecard — HIGH 0→2 resets criterion 2; the gap-closing pass validated that stale cells still hid HIGH bugs; added the import MED to permanently-accepted gaps.
- Files: `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`, `docs/audit/passes/PASS-15.md`, `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-18 — Test (Pass 15 canary): guard ListObjectHrefs nested-collection filter

- **Canary escape** (test-coverage hole, not a code bug): `ListObjectHrefs` excludes a member with `strings.TrimRight(href,"/") == collection || r.isCollection()`, but the shared fixture's only collection had an href *equal* to the query path — so the path-equality clause masked the loss of `isCollection()`, and dropping it passed the suite. A regression would leak a nested sub-collection href (e.g. a scheduling `inbox/`) as a member resource, which the per-resource download fallback would then GET as an event object.
- **Guard**: new `TestListObjectHrefsExcludesNestedCollection` with a fixture containing a nested sub-collection whose href ≠ the query path, asserting it is excluded. Adversarially verified: dropping `|| r.isCollection()` makes this test FAIL; reverting restores green. `listobjects.go` unchanged (code already correct).
- Files: `internal/caldav/listobjects_test.go`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 15 HIGH #2): stale-temp sweep no longer deletes a legitimate .ics on Open

- **Bug**: `loadCalendar`'s stale-temp sweep used `isStaleTempName` = `HasPrefix(".") && Contains(".tmp-")`, matching any dot-prefixed name *containing* `.tmp-`. A real resource whose UID sanitized to such a name (e.g. `.tmp-important@host` → `.tmp-important_host.ics`) was `os.Remove`'d on every `Store.Open` — permanent loss for an offline-created, not-yet-pushed item, and reachable from a hostile import href.
- **Fix**: `isStaleTempName` now requires the actual leftover shape — a dot-prefixed name **ending** in `.tmp-<digits>` (what `os.CreateTemp(dir, "."+base+".tmp-*")` produces; the `*` is replaced with decimal digits). A real resource ends in `.ics`, so it can never match. The sweep still removes genuine leftovers (guarded by the existing `TestOpenSweepsStaleTempFiles`, whose `.e@test.ics.tmp-123456` confirms the shape).
- **Repro-first**: `internal/store/staletemp_test.go` (`TestStaleTempSweepSpareLegitimateResource`) — `.tmp-important_host.ics` was deleted on reload; now survives.
- Files: `internal/store/store.go`, `internal/store/staletemp_test.go`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 15 HIGH #1): CalDAV writes no longer silently succeed on an HTTP redirect

- **Bug**: the shared `http.Client` used Go's default redirect policy, which follows a 301/302/303 on any method and downgrades PUT/DELETE to a bodyless GET — dropping the request body and the `If-Match`/`If-None-Match` conditionals. A 200/204 on the followed GET landed in `PutObject`/`DeleteObject`'s success set, so the call returned success though the write never landed; sync then cleared the dirty flag and the edit was silently lost with no retry. Triggered by any `http://` endpoint or a reverse proxy doing http→https / trailing-slash normalization (violates never-silently-overwrite/lose).
- **Fix**: `NewClient` installs a method-aware `CheckRedirect` that returns `http.ErrUseLastResponse` when the original request method is a write (`isWriteMethod`: PUT/DELETE/POST/PROPPATCH/MKCALENDAR/MKCOL/MOVE/COPY), so a 3xx is returned as-is; reads and RFC 6764 `.well-known` discovery still follow redirects. `PutObject`/`DeleteObject` now treat any 3xx as an explicit error (a write must land on the exact href, never a proxy-chosen Location). Only set when the caller didn't supply their own `CheckRedirect`.
- **Repro-first**: `internal/caldav/redirect_test.go` (`TestPutObjectRedirectMustNotReportSuccess`, `TestDeleteObjectRedirectMustNotReportSuccess`) — a 301→GET on PUT/DELETE previously returned success; now returns an error.
- Files: `internal/caldav/client.go`, `internal/caldav/object.go`, `internal/caldav/redirect_test.go`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Audit: Pass 15 gap-closing pass over the stale/never matrix cells

- Ran the `hardening-audit` workflow (32 agents) with explicit targets — the stale/never headless cells `main.md`'s convergence paragraph named: CalDAV response-parse fault-injection (stale since pass 7), store write-pipeline disk-fault atomicity + a first direct `-race` of the store write primitives, the reconcile keep-both/Forget/read-only-twin data-loss branches, and (as the plan added) the never-audited import ingest path.
- **3 confirmed findings, all repros observed red** (HIGH 2 · MED 1): (HIGH) `PutObject`/`DeleteObject` silently report success when a write is answered with a 301/302/303 — Go's default redirect policy downgrades PUT/DELETE to a bodyless GET, dropping body + `If-Match`, and a 200/204 on the followed GET lands in the success set; (HIGH) `loadCalendar`'s stale-temp sweep runs before the `.ics` filter, so a real `.tmp-*.ics` resource is deleted on Open; (MED) importing a resource that mixes a UID-bearing with a UID-less component fails whole-resource encode and drops the valid sibling. **1 of 3 canaries escaped** (`ListObjectHrefs` nested-collection filter). No new root-cause class.
- **Convergence impact (honest):** HIGH resurged 0→2 after pass 14's first no-HIGH pass, so the two-consecutive-no-HIGH criterion **resets to zero**. This validates the gap-closing decision: the stale/never cells genuinely still hid HIGH data-loss bugs at the CalDAV-write and store-load boundaries the model-heavy passes had deprioritized — not merely a MED/LOW tail. Confirms criterion 1 (matrix covered once) must precede trusting the severity trend.
- Independently verified before relaying: both HIGH repros run red, build compiles, ledger + pass report written; removed the 3 leaked canary worktrees. The MED import repro was written+run+removed by the workflow (not in the tree) — to be recreated at fix time.
- Files: `docs/audit/passes/PASS-15.md` (new). Fixes land in following repro-first commits; `COVERAGE.md` finalized with them.

## 2026-07-18 — Audit protocol: reframe convergence as a severity-weighted trend with explicit criteria

- Addressed a methodology question (14 passes, "never converged" — is the audit too narrow?): the diagnosis is not narrowness but a mis-set target. "Zero findings" is unreachable (real software keeps a MED/LOW tail; the workflow is built never to return "clean"; the Pi hardware surface can't be audited headlessly), and raw finding count (flat ~5–7) masks the real signal — HIGH severity fell 5→1→0 across passes 10→13→14.
- **`docs/audit/PROTOCOL.md`**: replaced the qualitative "The stop rule" with an explicit, measurable **"Convergence — the stop rule"**: converged-for-release requires *all* of (1) headless surface×method matrix covered ≥1×, (2) two *consecutive* passes with no HIGH, (3) no *new* root-cause MED class in those passes, (4) rising trigger cost, (5) canary escape rate ~0 — measured as a severity-weighted trend, not a count. Converged means drop to spot re-sweeps, not stop. Each `PASS-N.md` must now record HIGH·MED·LOW **and** whether any MED was a new class, so the two-pass test is auditable.
- **`main.md`**: rewrote the Build Plan convergence paragraph to point at the criteria and give the honest scorecard — trend healthy (HIGH→0), but not yet converged (matrix incomplete: CalDAV response-parse, disk-fault atomicity, reconcile keep-both/Forget, mouse/`:config`; only one no-HIGH pass; pass 14 added a new class). Estimated ~2–3 focused passes out.
- **`docs/audit/passes/PASS-14.md`**: added the "new root-cause class this pass: yes" record and reframed the convergence prose against the criteria.
- Owner chose "reframe, keep deep passes" over broadening search width — depth is what surfaced pass 14's subtle semantic bugs; breadth's role is only to close remaining matrix cells faster.
- Files: `docs/audit/PROTOCOL.md`, `main.md`, `docs/audit/passes/PASS-14.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-18 — Docs: finalize Pass 14 (guardrail, ledger, pass report, build plan)

- **CLAUDE.md**: added a 5th Hard-won guardrail — *RDATE/EXDATE are multi-valued and independent of the RRULE's COUNT/UNTIL bound* — codifying the root-cause class shared by fixes #2/#4/#5 (per the audit protocol's recurring-class rule: tests protect existing code, only the guardrail protects future code). Points at `resolveDateTimeValues`/`filterRDates`/`rruleIterationsBefore` and their regression tests.
- **COVERAGE.md**: flipped the four pass-14 ledger rows (recurrence write-side, quick-add, timezone, sync reconcile) from UNFIXED to fixed-pass-14 with the mechanism; moved the DayAgenda canary from OPEN blind-spot to CLOSED (guard added, mutation-verified); refreshed the escaped-canary section.
- **PASS-14.md**: status line updated from "NONE fixed" to all-6+canary fixed, keeping the body as point-in-time as-found evidence.
- **main.md**: added the one-line Pass 14 entry to the v1.0.x Build Plan ledger and refreshed the remaining-targets paragraph (reconcile matrix now 3 cells fixed; CalDAV response-parse + disk-fault atomicity surfaced as the stale targets).
- No README change: the quick-add fix makes behavior match the already-documented "leaves anything ambiguous in the title" principle.
- Files: `CLAUDE.md` (guardrail hunk only — a pre-existing unrelated session-startup edit was left unstaged), `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`, `docs/audit/passes/PASS-14.md`, `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 14 #6): keep-local of a server-deleted conflict now converges

- **Bug**: for a server-delete-vs-dirty conflict, `markConflict` stores an empty `ServerETag`; `ResolveKeepLocal` adopted that empty ETag but left `Href` non-empty, so the next reconcile hit `case !onServer && r.Dirty` (`sync.go`) and re-flagged the identical server-deleted conflict rather than reaching the create path (`r.Href=="" && r.Dirty`). The kept local version was never pushed back — the conflict recurred indefinitely and the item could never be resurrected server-side.
- **Fix**: `ResolveKeepLocal` now clears `Href` when the conflict is a server *deletion* (`cm.ServerDeleted`), routing the next reconcile to the create path so the item is re-created on the server. The non-deleted (server-edited) case is unchanged — it keeps the Href and adopts the server ETag for a conditional overwrite.
- **Repro-first**: `internal/sync/keeplocal_serverdeleted_test.go` (`TestKeepLocalServerDeletedConverges`) — first sync flags the server-deleted conflict, keep-local clears it, second sync re-raised it (`conflicts==1`) and pushed nothing; now the second sync converges (`conflicts==0`) and re-creates the item on the server.
- Files: `internal/store/conflict.go`, `internal/sync/keeplocal_serverdeleted_test.go`. Full gate + `-race` on internal/sync + internal/store green.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 14 #1): pushDelete's 412 branch no longer swallows a delete-vs-server-change conflict

- **Bug**: on a conditional DELETE returning 412 (server changed under a local delete), `st.ClearTombstone` ran unconditionally *outside* the nested resurrect/flag guard. When the server version was unparseable, or (degraded download) the resource's individual GET failed so `serverByHref` lacked the href, the resurrect + `stashServerConflict` block was skipped but the tombstone was still erased — no conflict recorded, tombstone gone (violating never-silently-overwrite). In the parse-fail case no `recordSkip` fired either, so the CTag cached and the next sync's short-circuit permanently swallowed the server's change; in the degraded case the next full sync re-pulled the item clean, silently un-deleting it.
- **Fix**: the 412 branch now clears the tombstone **only** after the conflict is actually resurrected (`PutRemote`) and flagged (`stashServerConflict`). If the server version is missing from `serverByHref`, unparseable, or the resurrect write fails, it keeps the tombstone and records a skip — the skip prevents CTag caching so the next full sync retries the conditional delete.
- **Repro-first**: `internal/sync/tombstone412_conflict_test.go` (`TestTombstone412DegradedDownloadKeepsConflict`) — 412 with a degraded download (bulk + individual GET both fail): was `Conflicts=0` AND tombstones empty; now the tombstone survives to retry. Existing `TestSyncTombstoneVsServerEditIsConflict` (happy path) still green.
- Files: `internal/sync/sync.go`, `internal/sync/tombstone412_conflict_test.go`. Full gate + `-race` on internal/sync green.

## 2026-07-18 — Test (Pass 14 canary): guard DayAgenda's inclusive midnight boundary

- **Canary escape** (test-coverage hole, not a code bug): `DayAgenda`'s due-date window uses an inclusive lower bound `!t.Due.Before(dayStart)` (Due ≥ dayStart), but `TestDayAgenda`'s todos are due at 09:00 and dayEnd+1h — none exactly at dayStart — so flipping the bound to exclusive (`Due.After(dayStart)`) passed the suite while silently dropping any todo due at 00:00 (the natural due time for a date-only/all-day todo).
- **Guard**: new `TestDayAgendaIncludesTodoDueAtMidnight` puts a todo due exactly at `dayStart` and asserts it appears. Adversarially verified: the injected `Before→After` mutation makes this test FAIL and reverting restores green — the canary is now closed. `agenda.go` is unchanged (the code was already correct).
- Files: `internal/model/agenda_test.go`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 14 #5): this-and-future split no longer duplicates a trailing RDATE

- **Bug**: `CapSeries` caps the past half by setting only the RRULE's UNTIL/Count — but UNTIL bounds only the RRULE generator (rrule-go's `Set.Iterator` merges RDATEs independent of UNTIL), so a trailing RDATE after the cut stayed on the capped master, and `NewSeriesFrom` copied every master prop (including that RDATE) into the future series. The one-off RDATE instant was emitted by BOTH resources — one more occurrence than the original, contradicting `main.md:362` and the iron rule (a single unmodeled property becoming two live occurrences).
- **Fix**: new `filterRDates` partitions a component's RDATE values by a time predicate (handling comma-multi-valued lines and preserving `VALUE=PERIOD` text; unresolvable values kept — iron rule). `CapSeries` drops RDATEs after the cut; `NewSeriesFrom` keeps only RDATEs at or after the split point — so each RDATE lands in exactly one half.
- **Repro-first**: `internal/model/recur_split_rdate_test.go` (`TestSplitDoesNotDuplicateTrailingRDate`) — FREQ=WEEKLY;COUNT=4 + trailing RDATE (5 total), split at 3rd instance: the RDATE appeared in both halves (total 6), now appears once (total 5).
- Files: `internal/model/recur_edit.go`, `internal/model/recur_split_rdate_test.go`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 14 #4): this-and-future split no longer adds a phantom occurrence past an EXDATE

- **Bug**: `main.md:362` promises a bounded COUNT is preserved across a this-and-future split so the total occurrence count is unchanged, but `NewSeriesFrom` reduced the future series' COUNT by `occurrencesBefore`, which counted the *EXDATE-filtered visible* recurrence set. RFC 5545 COUNT bounds the RRULE generator and an EXDATE'd instance still consumes COUNT, so every pre-split EXDATE undercounted the past half by one, leaving the future COUNT one too high and appending an occurrence the original series never had (app-reachable via delete-this-occurrence then this-and-future edit).
- **Fix**: replaced `occurrencesBefore` with `rruleIterationsBefore`, which builds a set from the RRULE alone (excluding EXDATE and RDATE) and counts iterations strictly before the split point — the actual COUNT units the capped past half consumes.
- **Repro-first**: `internal/model/recur_split_exdate_test.go` (`TestSplitPreservesCountWithPreSplitEXDATE`) — FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=5, delete day2, split at day4: total after split was 5 (phantom day6), now 4.
- Files: `internal/model/recur_edit.go`, `internal/model/recur_split_exdate_test.go`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 14 #3): quick-add rejects an impossible day-of-month

- **Bug**: `parseNumericDate`/`parseDate` accepted any day 1..31 and handed it to `time.Date`, which normalizes an out-of-range day into the next month (`2/30` → Mar 2), then `rollForwardMonthDay` pushed it a year forward — so `x 2/30`, `x feb 30`, `x 4/31`, `x jun 31` all silently became wrong dates, while the ISO form (`x 2026-02-30`) correctly rejected it. The same logical input parsed one way slashed and another as ISO, violating the parser's "when in doubt, leave text in the title rather than guess" principle.
- **Fix**: new `validYMD` round-trips (year, month, day) through `time.Date` and rejects it if the normalized fields differ. `rollForwardMonthDay` now returns `(time.Time, bool)`, trying the current then next year and honoring a leap-only day (Feb 29) in whichever candidate year actually has it; both call sites (month-name path, slashed path) and the explicit-year branch drop an impossible day to "no date", leaving the tokens in the title — matching the ISO form.
- **Repro-first**: `internal/model/quickadd_dayrange_test.go` (`TestQuickAddInvalidDayOfMonth`) — asserts every invalid form stays in the title *and* valid dates (incl. past-date roll-forward and an explicit leap Feb 29) still parse, so the fix can't over-reject.
- Files: `internal/model/quickadd.go`, `internal/model/quickadd_dayrange_test.go`. Full gate green.

## 2026-07-18 — Fix (Pass 14 #2): multi-valued RDATE/EXDATE no longer collapses a series

- **Bug**: `resolveDateTime` parses only a single date-time, so an RFC-5545-valid comma-listed multi-valued `RDATE`/`EXDATE` on one property line (or a `VALUE=PERIOD` RDATE) errored — go-ical infers the value type from the whole line's length, which matches no date layout. `recurrenceSet` propagated the error and `Event.Occurrences` swallowed it by degrading to the lone DTSTART base instance, silently dropping the entire RRULE expansion.
- **Fix**: new `resolveDateTimeValues` (in `tz.go`) splits an RDATE/EXDATE property value on commas and resolves each sub-value (each inheriting the property's TZID/VALUE params, so a Windows/Outlook TZID still recovers), taking the start instant of a `VALUE=PERIOD` element. `recurrenceSet` now adds every resolved value instead of one. No on-disk change (Raw round-trips byte-for-byte); this is expansion-only.
- **Repro-first**: `internal/model/multivalue_dates_test.go` (`TestMultiValuedEXDATE`/`TestMultiValuedRDATE`) — 5-daily-minus-2-excluded and DTSTART+2-RDATE both expected 3 instances, got 1 before the fix; green after.
- Files: `internal/model/tz.go`, `internal/model/recurrence.go`, `internal/model/multivalue_dates_test.go`. Full gate (test + vet + staticcheck) green.

## 2026-07-18 — Audit: Pass 14 hardening audit (coverage-first workflow)

- Ran the `hardening-audit` workflow (44 agents) against the ledger's top stale/never surfaces: the sync reconcile local×server matrix (data-loss), the timezone/TZID resolver (fuzz — 6 passes stale), quick-add parser semantic correctness (input-edge), non-command key/chord dispatch (input-edge), the newer UI draw widgets (display stress), and the recurrence write-side transforms vs `main.md` promises (spec-diff).
- **6 confirmed findings, all with runnable failing-test repros observed red** (HIGH 0 · MED 5 · LOW 1): pushDelete 412 tombstone drop (silent conflict swallow), multi-valued RDATE/EXDATE collapse, quick-add invalid day-of-month, this-and-future split phantom EXDATE occurrence + duplicated trailing RDATE, and keep-local-of-server-deleted never converging. **1 of 3 mutation canaries escaped** (DayAgenda inclusive midnight boundary — unguarded). HIGH reached zero for the first time in several passes, but total ticked 5→6; phase **not converged**.
- Independently verified before relaying: every repro runs red, `internal/sync` compiles (the report's "leftover breaks the build" worry was stale), ledger + pass report written. Removed the workflow's leftover exploratory scratch test (`zzz_audit_test.go`, which passed) and the 3 disposable canary worktrees it failed to auto-remove.
- Files: `docs/audit/passes/PASS-14.md` (new). Fixes land in following repro-first commits; `COVERAGE.md` ledger is finalized with them.

## 2026-07-18 — Docs: CalDAV test server back online

- The owner reported the CalDAV/NextCloud test server is live again (offline since 2026-07-16), with its credentials being rotated. Updated `main.md` Current State in place: the "server offline" note now records it as back online (2026-07-18), with the caveat that the opt-in live suite must be re-pointed at the fresh test-account credentials before it can run. No live-server task is pending, so no credentials were needed; normal work stays headless.
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-17 — Workflow: add the /cleanup end-of-session command

- Automated the owner's habitual end-of-day prompt into a committed slash command, `.claude/commands/cleanup.md` (in-repo like `/audit`, so it works on any machine). Six ordered steps: survey (branch/status/worktrees/branches) → sweep residual disposable worktrees, merged branches, and stray throwaway files (ambiguous → keep and report; never touch `main`/`ai-init`/`ai-workspace`) → doc-currency pass against CLAUDE.md's The Documents rules (main.md in-place, README, log.md heading-count, COVERAGE.md) → notes.md (write a dated mid-arc entry if a task is in progress; otherwise ensure it's empty) → gate (`make check` when code changed) + commit + push to `ai-workspace` → short end-of-session report.
- CLAUDE.md: Workflow gains step 8 ("Session end: run /cleanup") — a legitimate HOW change (a new standard workflow tool, like /audit was).
- Files: `.claude/commands/cleanup.md` (new), `CLAUDE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-17 — Audit protocol: recurring root-cause classes must be codified as CLAUDE.md guardrails

- Closed a feedback-loop gap the owner spotted: nothing mandated updating CLAUDE.md when audits repeatedly exposed an unsafe coding practice. Evidence it was real: the bare-`Locate→Put` clobber pattern recurred across passes 11→12→13 and CLAUDE.md never gained a "route writes through `PutIfUnchanged`" guardrail during any of them — it landed only incidentally in the 2026-07-16 doc rewrite.
- **`docs/audit/PROTOCOL.md`**: new rule 9 — when a pass's findings share a root cause that is a coding *practice* (not a one-off bug), the fix is not complete until the banned practice / required pattern is recorded as a Hard-won guardrail in CLAUDE.md in the same increment; tests protect existing code, only the guardrail protects future code (the failure mode audits are worst at catching, since the ledger marks audited surfaces "recent").
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: mirroring rules-of-engagement bullet under Hardening Audits, so the fixing agent sees it at the point of action. A legitimate HOW change (it changes what "done fixing" means).
- Files: `docs/audit/PROTOCOL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-16 — Docs: add notes.md — short-term memory for tasks interrupted mid-arc

- New document completing the doc set: `notes.md` holds the state of a task in progress when a session ends **mid-arc** (remaining steps, blockers, temporary context) so the next session — agent or owner — picks the work up without reconstructing it. Charter (in its intro blockquote and CLAUDE.md's The Documents entry): **the healthy steady state is empty**; write it only when ending a session mid-task; date every entry; delete a task's notes in the same increment that writes its `log.md` completion entry; a note surviving several sessions is a misplaced main.md fact. Created empty (no task is currently mid-arc).
- CLAUDE.md wiring (a new document with a role = a legitimate HOW change): Session Startup gains step 3 (read `notes.md`; if non-empty, resume or explicitly hand back the interrupted work before starting anything new), The Documents gains the `notes.md` subsection, Workflow step 1 updated. main.md's repo-layout tree lists the file.
- Files: `notes.md` (new), `CLAUDE.md`, `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-16 — Docs: restore the two facts the doc-refactor verification found lost

- An independent verification agent traced every fact deleted by the three spec-doc refactor commits (`ad1f777`/`da47b23`/`417be1a`) through the current main.md / CLAUDE.md / README.md / log.md / docs/audit/. Verdict: everything survived — every design decision, rejected-alternative rationale, safety warning, named test, and guardrail — except two minor items, both restored:
  - The **fan-out sizes of passes 11–13** (51/48/44 agents) existed only in the deleted main.md pass narrative (pass 10's "63 agents" survives in log.md). Added a `Run size:` header line to `docs/audit/passes/PASS-{11,12,13}.md`, the natural home for run statistics.
  - Pass 9's explicit **"UI input surface and sidecar-corruption path audited and found already sound"** verdict had become implicit (ledger rows only). Restored the sentence to main.md's pass-9 ledger line — a "no bug found" verdict is coverage information, same as passes 6/8.
- Files: `docs/audit/passes/PASS-11.md`, `PASS-12.md`, `PASS-13.md`, `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-16 — Docs: trim README.md to an end-user guide and reorder to the first-run flow

- Third of three spec-doc refactors. The README is now purely for the end user (summary, build/install, configuration, usage + keybindings); a curious user reads main.md for the development process.
  - **Deleted the Status blockquote** (build-step history, the thirteen-pass hardening narrative, the data-loss-class taxonomy, "approaching 1.0" framing) — all recorded in main.md's Build Plan ledger, `log.md`, and `docs/audit/`.
  - **Deleted the Hardening audits subsection** (audit-workflow description, fuzz + live-suite instructions) — verified duplicated in CLAUDE.md's Coding Standards/Hardening Audits and `docs/audit/PROTOCOL.md` before deletion, incl. the test-account-only warning.
  - **Development section** shrunk to a two-line pointer at main.md / log.md / docs/audit / CLAUDE.md; dropped `make check` from Build & Install (dev task; lives in CLAUDE.md).
  - **Reordered to the first-run flow**: What it does → Build & Install → Configuration → Usage (key table promoted to a `### Keybindings` heading) → Syncing → Managing calendars → Raspberry Pi → Development → License (previously Build & Install sat after 120 lines of usage).
  - Rephrased status-flavored wording in the Pi Performance paragraph ("used to be quadratic", "hasn't been benchmarked yet") as present-tense guidance; user-facing content otherwise verbatim.
- Files: `README.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-16 — Docs: rewrite CLAUDE.md as a timeless HOW-only agent orientation

- Second of three spec-doc refactors. CLAUDE.md now contains no build-state — every sentence stays true regardless of project phase, so it only changes when the way of working fundamentally changes. New structure:
  - **What This Project Is** — one timeless paragraph (identity, libraries, platform) and a hard stop pointing at main.md.
  - **Session Startup** (new) — agents must read `main.md` + `log.md` and confirm the `ai-workspace` branch before any task.
  - **The Documents** (new — the anti-drift core) — one subsection per doc with its role + maintenance rule: main.md = WHAT (update in place, no nullified decisions, features planned as `v1.x.0` Build Plan subsections first), CLAUDE.md = HOW (never project state), README = end-user guide only, log.md (the Log Format section moved here whole), `docs/audit/` (protocol/ledger/pass reports), `examples/spec_examples/` (reference only).
  - **Hardening Audits** — the `/audit` workflow how-to kept, rephrased timelessly (dates, "default to audits" phase statement, and the pass-10 anecdote moved to main.md/log.md; the "treat workflow summaries as unverified" lesson kept as the rule it produced).
  - **Architecture Rules** — hard rules kept verbatim; new **Hard invariants** list (iron rule, `.ics` = source of truth, no silent overwrite, app never writes config, read-only never written) extracted from the deleted Project Context bullets; **Hard-won guardrails** kept with fix-dates/pass-numbers stripped, plus a new fourth guardrail naming the `PutIfUnchanged`/rollback write-path pattern.
  - Workflow / Git Branching Rules / Coding Standards kept essentially verbatim.
- Deleted: the Project Context section (the ~1500-word UI bullet and the Local cache / Data model / Sync / Config bullets) — verified duplicated in main.md before deletion; the handful of orphaned design decisions were ported to main.md in the previous increment. No coverage-map change needed (guardrail content relocated within CLAUDE.md, none weakened).
- Files: `CLAUDE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-16 — Docs: restructure main.md — versioned Build Plan, prose sections, in-place decisions

- First of three spec-doc refactors (doc-role cleanup: main.md = WHAT, CLAUDE.md = HOW, README = end-user guide). main.md restructured to short prose paragraphs under finer headings, no content dropped:
  - **Versioned Build Plan**: the 13 steps now live under `### v1.0.0 — complete (2026-07-12)`; the pass-by-pass hardening narrative (≈10 dense paragraphs) is compressed into a `### v1.0.x — hardening & audit (ongoing)` one-line-per-pass ledger (method/surface → headline result → infrastructure added, "no bug found" passes included) + a residual-targets paragraph; a `### Future versions` note records the convention (new features planned as `### v1.x.0` subsections before implementation). The detailed pass records remain in `log.md` + `docs/audit/passes/` — verified present there before condensing.
  - **Absorbed design decisions that previously lived only in CLAUDE.md**: the recurring-todo single-live-instance model incl. the rejected occurrence-expansion (new Settled Decision + UI Design "Recurring items"), COUNT preservation across a series split, yank/paste move semantics (same-list re-parent vs cross-list recreate+delete, all-or-nothing with rollback, `CopyTodo` UID remap), grab-mode commit/revert semantics incl. the this-and-future split-on-grab-start two-resource revert, the Calendars-row `●` color bullet (hidden drops it), Space-on-a-drilled-event flashes, search scope, and the incremental-CTag skip rule + the `sync-collection` deliberate-deferral rationale.
  - **In-place updates** (history lives in log.md): merged the duplicate Status blockquote/Current State into one Current State section (v1.0.0 complete, hardening phase, server-offline note), Version 0.0.1 → 1.0.0, removed the keymap-history aside and the Open Decisions resolved-history sentence, folded the step-10-finale/step-11 landings into their steps' own descriptions.
- No code touched; no coverage-map change needed (all audit content relocated/condensed, none removed from the record).
- Files: `main.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-16 — Refactor: rename lingering *_repro_test.go regression tests to permanent names

- Tidiness pass (test-only, no behavior change). Five regression tests still carried the interim `*_repro_test.go` filename + `TestRepro*` function name from passes 9–10, which misleadingly reads as "throwaway repro" — they are permanent regression guards. Renamed via `git mv` + a function-name rename (dropping `Repro`/`REPRO`):
  - `internal/model/repro_duedur_test.go` → `duedur_test.go` (`TestVTodoDueAndDuration`)
  - `internal/model/repro_durnodtstart_test.go` → `durnodtstart_test.go` (`TestVTodoDurationNoDTStart`)
  - `internal/model/emptyvtimezone_repro_test.go` → `emptyvtimezone_test.go` (`TestEmptyVTimezoneBlocksEncode`)
  - `internal/ui/bundled_copy_repro_test.go` → `bundled_copy_test.go` (`TestCopyBundledSibling`)
  - `internal/ui/repro_coresident_move_test.go` → `coresident_move_test.go` (`TestCoResidentMoveDragsBystander`)
- Each test function is referenced only in its own file and in `docs/audit/passes/PASS-10.md`; updated those PASS-10 cross-reference pointers to the new paths/names so the historical report still resolves (its findings/prose are otherwise untouched). The one remaining `TestRepro*` mention in PASS-10 is `TestReproVJournalNestedCannotEncode`, a test that was removed after observation — intentionally left. No production code touched; the hardening these tests guard is unchanged, so no coverage-map update was needed.
- Full repo gate + vet + staticcheck pass; the five renamed tests verified still running and green.
- Files: the 5 renamed test files, `docs/audit/passes/PASS-10.md`.

## 2026-07-16 — Refactor: consolidate scattered test helpers into per-package testhelpers_test.go

- Tidiness pass (test-only, no production change). The ICS-builder / object-finder test helpers had been re-defined ad hoc across many files (four near-identical VTODO/VEVENT builders and several finders), which is how `todoWithDescICS`/`todoICS`/`todoDescObj` proliferated. Gathered them into one canonical home per package so a new test reuses a builder instead of adding a fifth:
  - `internal/store/testhelpers_test.go`: `mustDecode`, `todoWithDescICS`, `todoICS`, `itoa`, `eventICS`, `findResource`, `findTd`, `findEvt` (moved verbatim from `store_test.go`/`complete_noclobber_test.go`/`quickfield_noclobber_test.go`/`grabclobber_test.go`). Merged the byte-identical duplicate `findTdDesc` into `findTd` (its one caller repointed).
  - `internal/ui/testhelpers_test.go`: `todoDescObj`, `findTdDesc`, `todoBySummary`, `todosBySummary` (moved from `editclobber_test.go`/`edit_test.go`/`copypaste_test.go`). The app-harness helpers (`newTestApp`/`newWritableTestApp`/`storeFixture`/`drawCells`) stay with the harness in `app_test.go`/`edit_test.go`.
- **Pure move, verified:** `Test`-function counts unchanged (store 37→37, ui 185→185); only helper *definitions* relocated (plus one exact-duplicate merge). No production code and no test assertions touched, so the audit hardening is intact — no coverage-map update needed. Removed the now-unused `model` imports the moves left behind.
- Full gate + `-race` (store) + vet + staticcheck on `internal/store` + `internal/ui` pass.
- Files: `internal/store/testhelpers_test.go` (new), `internal/ui/testhelpers_test.go` (new), and the six source test files trimmed.

## 2026-07-16 — Refactor: split edit.go — extract item form builders to itemforms.go

- Codebase-tidiness pass (no behavior change), post-pass-13 health review. `internal/ui/edit.go` had grown to 1312 lines (the largest file); extracted the cohesive **item-form-construction** concern — the `todoFields`/`eventFields` types and the ten form builders/readers (`newTodoForm`/`readTodoDraft`/`showTodoForm`/`presentTodoForm`/`showCreateTodoForm` and the event equivalents) — verbatim into a new `internal/ui/itemforms.go`. edit.go now holds the mutation *actions* (create/complete/delete/reparent/edit-orchestration/undo/refresh/modal plumbing); itemforms.go holds the form widgets they open. The generic `caretForm` widget stays in the pre-existing `forms.go`.
- **Pure move, verified:** the combined top-level symbol set of `edit.go`+`itemforms.go` is byte-identical to the original edit.go's (62 symbols, diff empty), so no logic changed and no hardening was touched — no coverage-map update needed. edit.go 1312→1014, itemforms.go 309.
- Full gate + vet + staticcheck on `internal/ui` pass.
- Files: `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/itemforms.go`.

## 2026-07-16 — Docs: record pass 13 across the ledger, pass report, main.md, README

- End-of-pass doc refresh (no code change). `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`: flipped the three pass-13 OPEN inventory rows (reconcile HIGH, CalDAV-idempotency 2×MED, spec-diff 2×MED) to *fixed*, marked all 4 escaped mutation canaries CLOSED with their regression-test names, and re-marked the `Locate→Put` systemic section RESOLVED (now naming the exhaustive-sweep lesson). `docs/audit/passes/PASS-13.md`: added an "ALL RESOLVED (2026-07-16)" status header over the point-in-time audit record. `main.md`: added the Pass 13 entry to the Hardening & audit phase and rewrote "Not yet audited (next)" — the reconcile case-matrix (beyond the fixed degraded-download cell), timezone/DST, UI draw widgets, and non-command input-edge are the stale surfaces; noted the CalDAV test server is offline as of 2026-07-16 (live suite can't run). `README.md`: twelve→thirteen hardening passes, folded the pass-13 fixes (edit-form/reparent clobber, degraded-download false-deletion, MKCALENDAR/DELETE idempotency) into the data-loss-class summary.
- Files: `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`, `docs/audit/passes/PASS-13.md`, `main.md`, `README.md`, `log.md`. (Also pruned the four leftover canary git worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/`.)

## 2026-07-16 — Pass 13 fix (HIGH): a degraded download no longer looks like a remote deletion

- Fixes pass-13 HIGH #1 (`internal/sync/sync.go`). When the bulk calendar-query (`DownloadAll`) fails, sync falls back to enumerating hrefs + a per-resource `GetObject`. A resource whose individual GET failed transiently (timeout/5xx) was **omitted from `serverObjs`**, so `reconcileCalendar` saw it as absent-from-server and treated it as a **remote deletion** — a clean local item was `Forget`-ten (`PulledDeletes++`) and a dirty one raised a **false `ServerDeleted` conflict**, even though the server's listing still contained it. Silent data loss on any flaky-network sync. `reconcileReadOnly` had the identical twin bug.
- **Fix:** `downloadResilient` now also returns the set of hrefs the server **listed but couldn't be fetched** this pass (populated only on the degraded path; nil when the bulk succeeds, so the complete-view case is byte-for-byte unchanged). Both reconcile paths gained a `case !onServer && unfetched[r.Href]` guard that leaves the local copy untouched — the failed GET is already recorded as a skip upstream, so the CTag isn't cached and the next sync retries the resource.
- Tests: `internal/sync/degraded_download_deletion_test.go` — the pass-13 repro promoted to three regression tests: clean resource not Forgotten, dirty resource not falsely conflicted (local edit preserved + still Dirty), and a two-sync test asserting the CTag isn't cached after a skip so the next sync re-downloads and picks the resource up (this also closes pass-13 canary escape #2 on the sync side). Verified red before the fix, green after. Full gate + `-race` + vet + staticcheck on `internal/sync` pass (the one remaining red, `mkcalendar_lost201_repro_test.go`, is the still-unfixed pass-13 MED #5, addressed next).
- Files: `internal/sync/sync.go`, `internal/sync/import.go`, `internal/sync/degraded_download_deletion_test.go`.

## 2026-07-16 — Pass 13 fix (MED): edit form + recurrence-scoped saves route through PutIfUnchanged

- Fixes pass-13 MED #2 (`internal/ui/edit.go` `applyMutation`), reopening the Locate→Put clobber class pass 12 declared "structurally closed" — its spot check missed the edit form, the app's longest clobber window. `applyMutation` is the shared commit tail for the task/event edit forms *and* every recurrence-scoped save (edit occurrence, delete this & future, delete occurrence, skip occurrence — `commitMutation`/`commitMutationKeepingDrill`), and it used the unguarded `store.Put`. A background sync pull landing while the form was open was silently overwritten: the stale Save adopted the pulled ETag while persisting the form's pre-pull content, so the next push's CAS matched the server and the remote edit was lost with no conflict.
- **Fix:** `applyMutation` now version-checks an edit (`prev != nil`) via `store.PutIfUnchanged(prev)` and, on a mismatch, skips the write and returns `stale=true` — the wrappers then refresh to show the server's version and flash "Changed on the server — not applied; reopen and retry" instead of clobbering. A creation (`prev == nil`) has no prior version and still uses plain `Put`. This matches the grab / quick-field / Space-complete paths fixed in passes 11–12.
- Tests: `internal/ui/editclobber_test.go` (`TestApplyMutationDoesNotClobberConcurrentPull`) — a UI-level test that drives the real `applyMutation` (the pass-12 store-level repro drove `store.Put` directly and so couldn't validate the UI fix; removed). It seeds a synced todo, lands a guarded concurrent pull, then Saves a stale edit and asserts the remote DESCRIPTION survives clean and `applyMutation` reports the write skipped. Verified red on the old unguarded write, green with the fix. Full gate + vet + staticcheck on `internal/ui` pass.
- Files: `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/editclobber_test.go`.

## 2026-07-16 — Pass 13 fix (MED): reparentSelected (H/L) routes through PutIfUnchanged

- Fixes pass-13 MED #3 (`internal/ui/edit.go` `reparentSelected`), the second unconverted Locate→Put site the pass-12 spot check missed. Indent/outdent did `Locate → SetTodoParent → plain store.Put`, so a background sync pull landing between its own Locate and Put (an internal TOCTOU) was silently clobbered — the write adopted the pulled ETag while persisting content derived from the now-stale snapshot, and the next push's CAS matched the server and overwrote the remote edit.
- **Fix:** the commit is now `store.PutIfUnchanged(loc.Prev)`; on a mismatch the write is skipped, the view refreshes to the server's version, and the user is told "Task changed on the server — move not applied; retry" (no undo pushed). Matches the grab / quick-field / Space-complete / edit-form paths.
- Tests: `internal/store/reparent_noclobber_test.go` (the pass-13 repro promoted to a permanent regression, rewritten to drive `PutIfUnchanged`; the old store-level repro drove plain `Put`). The reparent TOCTOU window is internal to the function (between its own Locate and Put), so — like the pass-11/12 grabclobber/quickfield/complete no-clobber tests — it replays the store sequence and asserts the guard skips the stale write and the pulled edit survives clean. Verified the assertion is exercised (skipped write, server summary intact). Full gate + vet + staticcheck on `internal/store` + `internal/ui` pass.
- Files: `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/store/reparent_noclobber_test.go`.

## 2026-07-16 — Pass 13 fix (MED): MKCALENDAR and DELETE are idempotent

- Fixes pass-13 MED #4 + #5 (`internal/caldav/mkcalendar.go`), one coherent class — a lost success response wedges a calendar in a pending state forever:
  - **DELETE (#4):** a 404/410 (the collection is already gone — the desired end state) was treated as a hard error, so `pushCalendarDeletes` kept the calendar pending-delete and retried every sync. Now 204/200/404/410 all count as success.
  - **MKCALENDAR (#5):** if a create's 201 was lost in transit the server already made the collection; the next sync retried MKCALENDAR and the server's 405 (URL already mapped, RFC 4791 §5.3.1) was a permanent skip → wedged pending-create forever. Now 201 *or* 405 counts as success, so the retry adopts the collection and clears pending-create.
- **Note:** `TestCreateCalendarError` previously asserted a 405 was an error — directly contradicting the fix — so it was retargeted to a genuine failure status (507 Insufficient Storage) to keep the error path covered.
- Tests: `internal/caldav/mkcalendar_test.go` — `TestDeleteCalendarAlreadyGoneIsIdempotent` (404 + 410 → nil, added by the audit; was red) and new `TestCreateCalendarAlreadyExistsIsIdempotent` (405 → nil); `internal/sync/mkcalendar_lost201_test.go` (`TestMKCalendarLost201RecoversInsteadOfWedging`) — the pass-13 repro promoted to a regression: the fake models the fixed idempotent client, and after a lost 201 the second sync's retry clears pending-create (CalendarsCreated=1, no 405 skip) instead of wedging. All verified green; the caldav idempotency tests were red pre-fix. Full gate + vet + staticcheck on `internal/caldav` + `internal/sync` pass.
- Files: `internal/caldav/mkcalendar.go`, `internal/caldav/mkcalendar_test.go`, `internal/sync/mkcalendar_lost201_test.go`.

## 2026-07-16 — Pass 13: close the 4 escaped mutation-canary coverage holes

- Adds regression tests for the four mutations the pass-13 canaries slipped past (the code was correct today; the *net* had holes). Each verified to have teeth — re-applied the exact mutation and confirmed the new test fails, then reverted and confirmed green:
  - **LayoutDay lane-minimality at a touching boundary** (`internal/model/timegrid_test.go` `TestLayoutDayTouchingBoundary`): two occurrences where one ends exactly when the next starts don't overlap. Two sub-cases — a standalone block touching an overlap cluster stays `Lanes=1` (catches the cluster-flush `!start.Before`→`start.After` mutation) and a freed lane is reused at a touching boundary rather than opening a third (catches the lane-free `!le.After`→`le.Before` mutation).
  - **DeleteObject empty-ETag If-Match:\*** (`internal/caldav/object_test.go` `TestDeleteObjectEmptyETagSendsIfMatchStar`): inspects the outgoing header — an empty stored ETag must still send `If-Match: *` so the delete stays conditional (dropping the fallback = a blind unconditional DELETE).
  - **Config read size cap** (`internal/config/config_test.go` `TestLoadCapsReadSize`): a file with valid TOML before `maxConfigBytes` and garbage after — a capped read parses, an uncapped read hits the garbage and errors (catches dropping `io.LimitReader`).
  - **CTag-not-cached-after-skip** (canary #2) was already closed by the HIGH #1 regression `TestDegradedDownloadDoesNotCacheCTagSoNextSyncRetries`; re-confirmed it catches the `==`→`>=` always-cache mutation.
- Full repo gate + vet + staticcheck pass.
- Files: `internal/model/timegrid_test.go`, `internal/caldav/object_test.go`, `internal/config/config_test.go` (all test-only).

## 2026-07-15 — Docs: record passes 11 + 12 across main.md and README

- End-of-session doc refresh (no code change). `main.md`: added the Pass 11 and Pass 12 entries to the "Hardening & audit phase" section and rewrote "Not yet audited (next)" — the pass-11/12 stale surfaces (grab-mode, recurrence-edit UI, sync concurrency/CTag/background goroutines, undo stack, quick-field/completion write paths, color/privilege PROPFIND decode) are now *recent*, the two recurring data-loss classes (`Locate→Put` no-version-check, `Restore`-replays-clean-and-stale) are structurally closed, and a whole-app spec-diff re-run is named as the next target. `README.md`: ten→twelve hardening passes, with the recent sweeps described as the two data-loss-class fixes (multi-write-without-rollback, read-modify-write-without-version-check) plus the STATUS-flatten and read-only fail-open.
- Files: `main.md`, `README.md`, `log.md`. (The session's `project-status` memory was also updated to pass 12 — outside the repo.)

## 2026-07-15 — Pass 12: close the 3 escaped mutation-canary coverage holes

- Adds the regression tests the pass-12 canaries exposed (all three escaped; the code is correct today but each path was unguarded against a plausible regression):
  - **Privilege write-content term** (`internal/caldav/privileges_writable_test.go` `TestPrivilegeWritableEachGrant`): the only writability fixture granted both `write` AND `write-content`, so dropping either term from `writable()`'s OR-chain escaped. New table asserts each of `write` / `write-content` / `bind` / `all` **independently** yields writable, and no-grant is read-only — so a write-content-only or bind-only NextCloud share can't silently be misclassified read-only.
  - **State `Save` atomicity** (`internal/state/state_atomic_test.go` `TestSaveWritesViaTempFile`): the doc promises a crash-atomic temp+rename but nothing asserted it, so replacing it with a direct `os.WriteFile` escaped. The test points `Save` at a directory path: temp+rename writes `path+".tmp"` then fails at the rename (leaving the temp file), whereas a direct in-place write fails immediately with no temp — root/platform-independent.
  - **Grab K-resize min-duration** (`internal/ui/grab_resize_min_test.go` `TestGrabResizeRejectsZeroDuration`): the only resize test grows the end (`J`), never shrinks to the equal boundary, so weakening `!End.After(Start)` → `End.Before(Start)` (allowing a zero-duration `end==start`) escaped. The test shrinks a 1-hour event by an hour and asserts the guard rejects it (end unchanged, strictly after start).
- Verified the net now has teeth: re-applied each mutation and confirmed the matching test **fails**, then reverted and confirmed green. Full gate + `-race` on caldav/state/ui pass.
- Files: `internal/caldav/privileges_writable_test.go`, `internal/state/state_atomic_test.go`, `internal/ui/grab_resize_min_test.go` (all test-only).

## 2026-07-15 — Pass 12 fix (MED): decode the href before keying the color/privilege/CTag maps

- Fixes pass-12 MED #7 (`internal/caldav/colors.go`, `privileges.go`, `ctag.go`): the PROPFIND side-channel maps were keyed by the **raw** `<href>` from the multistatus response, but `DiscoverCalendars` looks them up by `Calendar.Path`, which go-webdav produces by URL-**decoding** the href (`url.Parse(href).Path`). A percent-encoded segment (Google `user%40gmail.com`, a NextCloud `%20`) or an absolute-URL href (proxy-rewritten `https://host/…`) yielded a key that could never match → the calendar's **color was silently dropped**, and — worse — `privileges.go`'s read-only detection **failed open** (a genuinely read-only share looked writable, so the app would attempt writes the server rejects), and the CTag short-circuit missed (harmless, just a full re-download).
- **Fix:** new shared `hrefKey` (in `client.go`) normalizes a response href the same way go-webdav derives `Calendar.Path` — decode via `url.Parse().Path`, trailing slash trimmed — with a raw-href fallback if parsing fails. All four keying sites (color, privilege discover + reactive re-check, CTag) and the lookup key now use it, so both sides land in the same key space.
- Tests: `internal/caldav/colors_test.go` — `TestDiscoverColorsDecodesHrefKey` (percent-encoded + absolute hrefs resolve to decoded-path keys; the pass-12 repro re-created) and `TestHrefKey` (unit table, which backs all three sites). Verified red on the old raw-href keying, green with the fix. Full caldav gate + vet/staticcheck pass.

## 2026-07-15 — Pass 12 fix (MED): Space-complete + recurring-todo advance route through PutIfUnchanged

- Fixes pass-12 MED #5 (`internal/ui/edit.go` `toggleComplete`, `internal/ui/recur_edit.go` `advanceRecurringTodo`): both did Locate → build-from-stale-snapshot → `store.Put` with no version guard, so a concurrent sync pull landing in the window was clobbered (adopt pulled ETag onto stale content; next push CAS-matches and overwrites the server edit).
- **Fix:** both commit via `store.PutIfUnchanged(loc.Prev)` and, on `!applied`, `refreshKeepingDrill` + flash "Task changed on the server — not applied; retry". This closes the last two of the three systemic Locate→Put sites the pass-11/12 reports named (grab was fixed in pass 11; quick-field earlier this pass).
- Tests: `internal/store/complete_noclobber_test.go` (`TestSpaceCompleteDoesNotClobberConcurrentPull`) — the pass-12 repro, rewritten to drive `PutIfUnchanged`: the write is skipped and the pulled remote DESCRIPTION survives intact/clean. Existing complete/advance UI tests still pass. Full gate on ui/store passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/recur_edit.go`, `internal/store/complete_noclobber_test.go`.

## 2026-07-15 — Pass 12 fix (MED): quick sp/sd routes through PutIfUnchanged

- Fixes pass-12 MED #4 (`internal/ui/quickfield.go` `applyTodoField`): the quick field-set (`sp`/`sd`) did Locate → `EditTodo` → `store.Put` with no version guard, so a background sync pull landing in that window was clobbered (Put's `build(prev)` adopts the pulled ETag onto stale-derived content; the next push's CAS matches the server and overwrites the remote edit). The grab path already uses `PutIfUnchanged`; quick-field didn't.
- **Fix:** `applyTodoField` commits via `store.PutIfUnchanged(loc.Prev)` and, on `!applied`, refreshes and flashes "Task changed on the server — not applied; retry" rather than clobbering. (One of the three systemic Locate→Put sites the pass-11/12 reports flagged.)
- Tests: `internal/store/quickfield_noclobber_test.go` (`TestQuickFieldSetDoesNotClobberConcurrentPull`) — the pass-12 repro, rewritten to drive `PutIfUnchanged`: the write is skipped and the pulled server edit survives intact/clean. Full gate on ui/store passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/quickfield.go`, `internal/store/quickfield_noclobber_test.go`.

## 2026-07-15 — Pass 12 fix (HIGH + MED): undo of a synced edit/delete survives the next sync

- Fixes pass-12 HIGH #2 and MED #6 (`internal/store/mutate.go` + `internal/ui/edit.go` `undoLast`) — one root cause: `store.Restore` replays the undo snapshot **clean** (`Dirty=false`) with its old Href/ETag, but an undo is a fresh local change that must sync. So:
  - **HIGH — undo of a synced *delete*:** after the delete's tombstone had pushed, `Restore` brought the item back clean with an Href the server no longer has → next reconcile hit `case !onServer:` and `Forget` — the explicitly-restored item **vanished permanently** from store and server.
  - **MED — undo of a synced *edit*:** after the edit pushed (server at a newer ETag), `Restore` wrote the pre-edit content back with the **old** ETag + clean → next reconcile hit `case serverObj.ETag != r.ETag:` and **pulled the server copy back over the undo** (silent revert of the revert).
- **Fix:** new `store.RestoreDirty` writes the snapshot back marked `Dirty=true` (keeping the Href/ETag baseline); `undoLast` uses it. Now the resurrection/revert is a pending local change → sync **pushes it or raises a keep-both conflict** rather than dropping it, consistent with the never-silently-overwrite model. The verbatim `Restore` is unchanged and still used by the multi-write **rollback** paths (failed split/detach/grab), where the server was never touched so the clean snapshot is still accurate.
- Tests: `internal/sync/undo_after_delete_sync_test.go` (new, HIGH — resurrected item survives as a conflict, not Forgotten) and `internal/sync/undo_after_edit_sync_test.go` (the pass-12 repro, adapted to `RestoreDirty` — the revert sticks). Both verified red when `RestoreDirty` is neutered to replay clean, green with the fix. Full gate + `-race` on store/sync/ui pass.
- Files: `internal/store/mutate.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/sync/undo_after_delete_sync_test.go`, `internal/sync/undo_after_edit_sync_test.go`.

## 2026-07-15 — Pass 12 fix (HIGH + MED): EditTodo preserves completion state it isn't changing

- Fixes pass-12 HIGH #1 and MED #3 (`internal/model/edit.go` `EditTodo`) — one root cause. `TodoDraft.Completed` is a single bool, but VTODO STATUS is quad-state (NEEDS-ACTION / IN-PROCESS / COMPLETED / CANCELLED). A quick field-set (`sp`/`sd`) carries `Completed = td.Completed()` unchanged, and `EditTodo` unconditionally called `setCompleted(comp, d.Completed, now)`, which: (HIGH) flattened a foreign client's **IN-PROCESS/CANCELLED** task to `NEEDS-ACTION` and **dropped PERCENT-COMPLETE** on a routine priority/due bump; and (MED) **restamped an already-COMPLETED task's `COMPLETED` timestamp to now** — both silent, pushed to the server, and iron-rule breaches of the quick-set "change one field, leave the rest intact" contract.
- **Fix:** `EditTodo` now calls `setCompleted` only when the completed-ness actually changes (`d.Completed != isCompletedStatus(comp)`), so an edit that doesn't touch completion preserves the existing STATUS / PERCENT-COMPLETE / COMPLETED exactly. New helper `isCompletedStatus`. `NewTodoObject`, `SetTodoCompleted`, and the recurrence advance/detach paths still call `setCompleted` directly (they intend to set state), so their behavior is unchanged. The full edit form still flips state correctly (an explicit check/uncheck differs from the current status).
- Tests: `internal/model/edittodo_status_preserve_test.go` (IN-PROCESS + PERCENT-COMPLETE:50 survive an `sp`) and `internal/model/edittodo_completed_preserve_test.go` (COMPLETED timestamp not restamped) — the pass-12 repros, now green; both red pre-fix. Removed a stale hallucinated repro (`zz_completed_test.go`, wrong `Parse`/`Encode` API) the audit left behind. Full gate on model/ui passes.
- Files: `internal/model/edit.go`, `internal/model/edittodo_status_preserve_test.go`, `internal/model/edittodo_completed_preserve_test.go`.

## 2026-07-15 — Pass 11: close the 2 escaped mutation-canary coverage holes

- Adds the regression tests the pass-11 canaries exposed (the code is correct today; the *tests* didn't cover these boundaries, so a future off-by-one would ship silently):
  - **`clampIndex` upper bound** (`internal/ui/canary_boundaries_test.go` `TestClampIndexBoundaries`): table over `{i<0, 0, n-1, i==n, i>n, i==n with n=1}` — guards the `i >= n` clamp that backs vim-count nav and drilled-event selection (a count landing exactly on the list length hits `i == n`). The escaped mutation was `i >= n` → `i > n`.
  - **Month-grid event-drill j/k boundaries** (`TestCalendarViewEventDrillJKBoundaries`): drills into a 3-item day and steps down/up past both ends via **both** the `j`/`k` (KeyRune) and Down/Up (arrow) paths, asserting `eventIndex` stops at `len-1`/`0`. The escaped mutation was the down guard `< len(items)-1` → `<= len(items)-1`.
- Verified the net now has teeth: re-applied each mutation and confirmed the matching test **fails** (`clampIndex(1,1)=1` and `eventIndex=3` past the end), then reverted and confirmed green. Full gate + `-race` on store/sync/ui pass.
- Files: `internal/ui/canary_boundaries_test.go` (test-only).

## 2026-07-15 — Pass 11 fix (LOW): todo grab nudge re-checks HasDue after re-locate

- Fixes pass-11 LOW #7 (`internal/ui/grab.go` `grabNudge`): `startGrab` gates a todo grab on `HasDue`, but that snapshot goes stale — a concurrent sync can clear the due date mid-grab. The nudge's todo branch re-located the task but didn't re-check `HasDue`, so `draftFromTodo`'s zero `Due` was shifted by `AddDate` into a year-1 date, `EditTodo` wrote `HasDue=false` (nothing persisted), and the flash read a nonsensical "due Jan 1, year 1" — a confusing no-op that looked like a move.
- **Fix:** the todo branch now aborts via `abortGrabStale` when `!td.HasDue` (the due was cleared underneath) — refusing to fabricate a date and ending the grab *without* reverting (reverting would re-add the due and clobber the server's clear).
- Tests: `internal/ui/grab_duecleared_test.go` (`TestGrabTodoDueClearedMidGrab`) — the pass-11 repro, adapted to assert the post-fix invariants (no fabricated due persisted; grab ends). Verified red without the guard (still grabbing, bogus "due 01/01" flash), green with it. Full gate on ui passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/grab.go`, `internal/ui/grab_duecleared_test.go`.

## 2026-07-15 — Pass 11 fix (LOW): grab nudge uses a version-checked write (no concurrent-pull clobber)

- Fixes pass-11 LOW #6 (`internal/ui/grab.go` `grabNudge`): the nudge did Locate → derive `newObj` from that snapshot → `store.Put`, with no unchanged-check. A background sync that pulled a remote edit into the same resource in that window was clobbered — `Put`'s `build(prev)` adopted the pulled ETag while persisting the stale-derived content and marked it Dirty, so the next push's ETag CAS matched the server and overwrote the remote edit.
- **Fix:** new `store.PutIfUnchanged(ctx, calID, name, obj, expectedPrev)` (the write-side analogue of `PullRemote`'s pointer-identity guard) writes only if the cached resource is still the located snapshot; otherwise it returns `applied=false`. `grabNudge` passes `loc.Prev` and, on `!applied`, ends the grab via the new `abortGrabStale` — which does **not** revert (reverting would re-clobber the pulled edit), keeps the server's version, and tells the user the move wasn't applied.
- Scope note: this fixes the grab path. The same Locate→Put pattern is shared with quick-field edits and completion toggles; per the pass-11 report those remain a **systemic re-audit** target (logged in `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md` blind spots), not fixed here.
- Tests: `internal/store/grabclobber_test.go` (`TestGrabNudgeDoesNotClobberConcurrentPull`) — the pass-11 repro, rewritten to drive `PutIfUnchanged`: asserts the write is skipped and the pulled server edit survives intact/clean. Existing grab UI tests still pass. Full gate on store/ui passes.
- Files: `internal/store/mutate.go`, `internal/ui/grab.go`, `internal/store/grabclobber_test.go`.

## 2026-07-15 — Pass 11 fix (MED): cancelGrab surfaces revert failures instead of reporting a clean cancel

- Fixes pass-11 MED #4 (`internal/ui/grab.go` `cancelGrab`): the function discarded the error returns of `store.Delete`/`store.Restore` (`_, _ =` / `_ =`) and unconditionally flashed "Grab cancelled". On a this-&-future grab cancel, if the master un-cap `Restore` failed (ENOSPC/permission), the grabbed occurrence **and** all future occurrences were gone while the user was told the series was intact — silent data loss.
- **Fix:** capture the revert errors (`errors.Join` for the split case) and `flashErr` when any fail. Also **reordered** the split revert to restore the master *first* and delete the new tail series only if that succeeded — so a failed un-cap leaves the tail in place (a recoverable duplicate) rather than compounding into "both copies gone".
- Tests: `internal/ui/grab_cancel_error_test.go` (`TestGrabFutureCancelSurfacesRestoreFailure`) — forces the master un-cap to fail (directory planted over the master `.ics`) and asserts the flash surfaces the failure and the new tail was not deleted. Verified red on the old behavior (flashed "Grab cancelled"; tail deleted), green on the fix. The happy-path `TestGrabFutureCancelRestores` still passes. Full gate on ui passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/grab.go`, `internal/ui/grab_cancel_error_test.go`.

## 2026-07-15 — Pass 11 fix (MED): detached recurring-todo occurrence preserves unmodeled iCal props

- Fixes pass-11 MED #5 (iron-rule violation, `internal/ui/recur_edit.go`): "edit this occurrence" for a recurring todo built the standalone one-off via `model.NewTodoObject(draft)` — from the form's modeled fields only — so every unmodeled property (VALARM, ATTACH, URL, GEO, X-, non-PARENT RELATED-TO) was dropped from the detached task. The parallel *event* path already clones (`AddOccurrenceOverride`/`cloneOverrideComponent`); the todo path didn't.
- **Fix:** new `model.DetachTodoOccurrence` clones the original component (preserving all props + children), strips the recurrence props (RRULE/RDATE/EXDATE/RECURRENCE-ID) so it's a plain one-off, assigns a fresh UID, and applies the edited draft — the todo analogue of the event override's clone-and-mutate. `editTodoDetachForm` now uses it instead of `NewTodoObject`.
- Tests: `internal/model/detach_test.go` (`TestDetachOccurrencePreservesUnmodeledProps`) — the pass-11 repro, rewritten to exercise `DetachTodoOccurrence`: asserts the detached standalone keeps `X-APPLE-SORT-ORDER` + the full `VALARM`/`TRIGGER` block, carries a fresh UID, and drops the RRULE. Full gate on model/ui passes.
- Files: `internal/model/recur_edit.go`, `internal/model/detach_test.go`, `internal/ui/recur_edit.go`.

## 2026-07-15 — Pass 11 fix (HIGH): detaching a recurring-todo occurrence rolls back on a failed standalone write

- Fixes pass-11 HIGH #3 (`internal/ui/recur_edit.go` `editTodoDetachForm`): "edit this occurrence" for a recurring todo Puts the advanced series first (`AdvanceRecurringTodo` consumes the current occurrence), then Puts the detached standalone one-off carrying the edits. If the second Put failed there was no rollback and no undo — the occurrence was gone from the series and never became a one-off task, contradicting the confirm dialog's promise ("it becomes a separate one-off task"). Silent data loss on ENOSPC/permission/crash.
- **Fix:** extracted the store side into `commitDetach` (mirroring `commitSplit`), which on a failed standalone write `Restore`s the series from `loc.Prev` so the detach is atomic (both writes land or neither).
- Tests: `internal/ui/detach_rollback_test.go` (`TestCommitDetachRollsBackSeriesOnStandaloneWriteFailure`) — forces the standalone Put to fail (directory planted at its path) and asserts the series' due is unchanged (not advanced) and the standalone wasn't left behind. Verified red without the rollback (series advanced a week), green with it. Full gate on ui passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/recur_edit.go`, `internal/ui/detach_rollback_test.go`.

## 2026-07-15 — Pass 11 fix (HIGH): commitSplit rolls back the capped master when the future write fails

- Fixes pass-11 HIGH #2 (`internal/ui/recur_edit.go` `commitSplit`): an "edit this & future" event split does `model.SplitEvent` → `Put(capped master)` → `Put(future series)`. The capped Put truncates the master's RRULE (UNTIL just before the occurrence); if the future Put then fails (ENOSPC / permission / sidecar-write), the function returned early on a flash and `pushUndo` was never reached — the master was left **permanently truncated** and the future tail **never created**, unrecoverable from the UI. The sibling grab path (`beginGrabFuture`) already had this rollback; `commitSplit` was left unguarded.
- **Fix:** on a failed future Put, `Restore` the master from `loc.Prev` before returning, so the split is atomic (both writes land or neither), mirroring `beginGrabFuture`.
- Tests: `internal/ui/commitsplit_rollback_test.go` (`TestCommitSplitRollsBackMasterOnFutureWriteFailure`) — the pass-11 repro, adapted to assert recovery: it forces the second Put to fail (a directory planted at the future resource's path) and asserts the master is restored to its full 4 occurrences. Red pre-fix (master stuck at 2), green post-fix. Full gate on ui passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/recur_edit.go`, `internal/ui/commitsplit_rollback_test.go`.

## 2026-07-15 — Pass 11 fix (HIGH): PullRemoteBatch no longer clobbers a concurrent local edit

- Fixes pass-11 HIGH #1 (`internal/store/remote.go`): `PullRemoteBatch`'s per-resource `stageResourceLocked` write was unconditional (`Dirty:false`, no dirty/version check, unlike single-resource `PullRemote`). Sync builds its "new on server" pull list from a **pre-lock snapshot**, so a local edit that lands during step (A)'s network I/O — notably a crash-orphan (clean, href-less `.ics`) the user just re-edited — is invisible to the include-in-batch decision, and the batch write overwrote it and marked it clean. Silent data loss: the edit was gone in memory and on disk and never pushed. The pass-5 comment claiming these writes "can't clobber a concurrent local edit" was **false** for this case.
- **Fix:** each stage now skips a resource that already exists locally and is **Dirty** (a pending local edit), reporting the new sentinel `store.ErrKeptLocalEdit`; the edit survives and the next sync reconciles it (a href-less dirty resource is then a "new local resource, never pushed" → `pushCreate`). A **clean** local resource is still overwritten — that's the intended pass-5 crash-orphan self-heal (re-pull a clean, href-less `.ics`), so `Dirty` is the exact discriminator. Both callers (`sync.reconcileCalendar`, `sync.Import`) treat `ErrKeptLocalEdit` distinctly — neither count it as pulled/imported nor record it as a skipped failure (mirroring single-resource `PullRemote`'s silent `!applied`).
- Corrected the false pass-5 comment and the `PullRemoteBatch` doc comment to describe the guard.
- Tests: `internal/sync/pullbatch_clobber_test.go` (`TestReproPullBatchClobbersConcurrentEditToOrphan`) — the pass-11 repro, now green: an orphan edited during a sibling's in-flight PUT keeps its `"user-edit"` content and stays Dirty. Was red pre-fix. Full gate + `-race` on store/sync pass.
- Files: `internal/store/remote.go`, `internal/sync/sync.go`, `internal/sync/import.go`, `internal/sync/pullbatch_clobber_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Docs: record pass 10 + the audit workflow across main/README/CLAUDE

- End-of-session doc refresh (no code change). `main.md`: added the Pass 10 entry and an "Audit tooling" note, corrected the "Not yet audited" section (the go-ical encoder healing it listed as unfixed is now done; added the stale surfaces — grab-mode, sync concurrency/TOCTOU — as the next targets). `README.md`: nine→ten hardening passes, softened "1.0-ready" to "hardening-ongoing, not yet 1.0-blessed" (pass 10 did not converge), added a "Hardening audits" subsection pointing at `/audit` and `docs/audit/`. `CLAUDE.md`: added the audit-tooling note to the Phase line (run `/audit`, keep `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md` current, treat a workflow summary as unverified until checked).
- Files: `main.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `log.md`.

## 2026-07-13 — Pass 10 fix: close the 3 mutation-canary test-coverage holes

- Adds the missing regression tests the pass-10 canaries exposed (the code was already correct; the *tests* didn't cover these paths, so a future regression would ship silently):
  - **Backward search wrap** (`internal/ui/searchwrap_test.go`): drives `searchNext(-1)` from the first match; asserts it wraps to the last and cycles — guards the `(idx + dir + len) % len` negative-index path (a `+len` regression panics on `N`).
  - **PRIORITY out of range** (`internal/model/priorityrange_test.go`): PRIORITY `15`/`10`/`-1` parse to `PriorityUndefined`, `5` preserved — guards `priority()`'s `>9` clamp.
  - **Href-less pull orphan** (`internal/store/pendinghrefless_test.go`): a clean, href-less resource makes `HasLocalChanges`/`HasPendingChanges` true — guards the `|| r.Href == ""` reconcile clause (previously untested in the store package).
- Verified the net now has teeth: re-applied the priority canary mutation (`>9`→`>100`) and confirmed the new test **fails**, then reverted and confirmed it passes. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/searchwrap_test.go`, `internal/model/priorityrange_test.go`, `internal/store/pendinghrefless_test.go` (all test-only).

## 2026-07-13 — Pass 10 fix (MED): reconcile a crash between the .ics and sidecar renames

- Fixes pass-10 MED #8 (edit half): `writeResourceLocked` renames the `.ics` durably, then writes the sidecar. A crash/power-loss in that window (a real Pi/SD-card risk) left the new `.ics` beside the old sidecar (`Dirty=false`, prior ETag), so on reload the offline edit looked clean-and-synced and sync **never pushed it** — silent data loss.
- **Fix:** the sidecar now records a per-resource content hash (`resourceMeta.Hash`, fnv-64 of the exact bytes written, set in `stageResourceLocked`). On load, if the `.ics` hash differs from the sidecar's recorded hash, the `.ics` was rewritten after the sidecar (the crash window) → the resource loads **Dirty** so sync pushes it. Empty hash (legacy sidecar / untracked resource) is not enforced, so it's backward-compatible and doesn't disturb the pass-5 href-less pull-orphan clause (that path has no recorded hash).
- **Delete half — deliberately not "healed":** the symmetric case (`.ics` removed before the tombstone) currently re-pulls on next sync, which is **safe and recoverable** (the item returns; no data lost). Synthesizing a tombstone from a missing-`.ics`-with-href would risk *deleting server data* whenever a `.ics` merely went missing for another reason, so the safe re-pull is kept. Documented.
- Corrected the `writeResourceLocked` doc comment that overstated the guarantee ("a crash can never leave … inconsistent") to describe the hash-reconcile.
- Tests: `internal/store/crashreload_test.go` — a synced resource whose `.ics` is overwritten (sidecar untouched) reloads Dirty and `HasPendingChanges` true; a clean reopen is not spuriously dirty. Full gate + `-race` on store/sync pass.
- Files: `internal/store/{store,mutate,sidecar}.go`, `internal/store/crashreload_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Pass 10 fix (MED): :config honors a flag-bearing $EDITOR

- Fixes pass-10 MED #6: `:config` ran `exec.Command(editor, path)` with the whole `$EDITOR` string as the binary name, so any value carrying arguments — `code --wait`, `subl -w`, `emacsclient -c`, `vim -f` — failed with ENOENT and made `:config` unusable for those common editors.
- **Fix:** extracted `editorCommand(editorEnv, path)` which splits `$EDITOR` on whitespace into command + args (defaulting to `vi` when empty), so flags stay arguments. (Whitespace-in-path editor values remain unsupported — rare, and shelling out via `sh -c` would cost portability on the Windows target; documented.)
- Tests: `cmd/lazyplanner/main_test.go` `TestEditorCommandSplitsArgs` — `code --wait` → `[code --wait /cfg]`, bare `vim`, `emacsclient -c`, and the empty→`vi` default. Full gate passes.
- Files: `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `cmd/lazyplanner/main_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Pass 10 fix (HIGH + MED): yank/paste operates per-component on bundled resources

- Fixes the pass-10 bundled-resource data-loss class. LazyPlanner writes one item per `.ics`, but a foreign/hand-edited resource can bundle several top-level todos; `moveSubtree`/`copySubtree` acted on the whole `loc.Object`, so a cross-list **move** dragged co-resident bystanders to the destination and deleted them from the source (HIGH #5), and a **copy** duplicated them into the destination with their **original UIDs** (MED #9 — a phantom copy + a duplicate-UID-on-push integrity break).
- **New model primitives** (`internal/model/edit.go`): `IsolateComponent` (a copy holding only the selected item, co-resident sibling items dropped, non-item components like VTIMEZONE kept) and `RemoveComponent` (the object without the item, reporting whether any item remains). Both clone-first, so the store snapshot is never mutated.
- **Wiring** (`internal/ui/yankpaste.go`): copy isolates the item before `CopyTodo`; move isolates before the destination `Put`, and on the source side removes only that item — **rewriting** the resource when siblings remain, deleting the file only when it was the last item. Rollback/undo restore the full original either way. The normal one-item-per-file case is unchanged (isolate = identity, remove → empty → delete).
- Tests: the two untracked ui repros (`repro_coresident_move`, `bundled_copy_repro`) are now green; added `internal/model/isolate_test.go` (IsolateComponent drops siblings + doesn't mutate input; RemoveComponent reports remaining correctly). Full gate + `-race` on ui/store pass; the whole tree is green again.
- Files: `internal/model/edit.go`, `internal/model/isolate_test.go`, `internal/ui/yankpaste.go`, `internal/ui/{repro_coresident_move,bundled_copy_repro}_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Pass 10 fix (HIGH x4 + MED x1): heal decode-but-unencodable go-ical shapes

- Fixes the pass-10 encoder-constraint class — objects that decode but fail `Encode()`, poisoning the whole resource (every edit/push re-encodes). All reachable only via a foreign/bundled/hand-edited `.ics` (LazyPlanner never writes these shapes), but each breaks the iron rule for those inputs. Extended `model.Parse`'s ingest healers (add-only/drop-redundant, never mangle real data):
  - **`healComponentConstraints`** — drops a redundant `DURATION` when the encoder's mutual-exclusion/dependency rules would reject it: VEVENT with `DTEND`+`DURATION`; VTODO with `DUE`+`DURATION`; VTODO with `DURATION` but no `DTSTART`. DTEND/DUE (what the typed parser reads) is kept.
  - **`dropEmptyTimezones`** — drops a `VTIMEZONE` with no STANDARD/DAYLIGHT child (natural, or left childless after `stripForbiddenNesting`); runs *after* strip. An empty VTIMEZONE has no offset data and the app resolves zones via the embedded tz DB, so nothing usable is lost.
  - **VJOURNAL/VFREEBUSY nesting** — added empty allow-sets to `allowedChildren` so `stripForbiddenChildren` strips their (encoder-forbidden) nested components.
- Tests: the three untracked repro files are now green regression tests (`repro_duedur`, `repro_durnodtstart`, `emptyvtimezone_repro`); added `heal_encoder_test.go` covering DTEND+DURATION and VJOURNAL/VFREEBUSY (whose workflow repros were run-then-removed). Full gate passes (the remaining red is the yank/paste repros, fixed next).
- Files: `internal/model/decode.go`, `internal/model/{repro_duedur,repro_durnodtstart,emptyvtimezone_repro,heal_encoder}_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 10: stale-surface sweep (via the hardening-audit workflow) — findings pending fixes

- First run of the new `hardening-audit` workflow (63 agents, ~2.5M tokens, ~22 min). It targeted the surfaces the ledger still marked **stale** after pass 9. **9 findings confirmed with executed, RED repros (5 HIGH, 4 MED)** + **3 escaped mutation canaries** (test-coverage holes). Full report: `docs/audit/passes/PASS-10.md`; ledger updated in `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`.
- **HIGH (all iron-rule / data-loss, reachable via a foreign/bundled `.ics` — LazyPlanner never writes these shapes itself):** four decode-but-unencodable go-ical shapes the pass-4 healers don't cover (VEVENT DTEND+DURATION, VTODO DUE+DURATION, VTODO DURATION-without-DTSTART, empty VTIMEZONE — incl. one `stripForbiddenNesting` self-inflicts), each poisoning a whole resource on every re-encode; and cross-list yank/paste **move** dragging co-resident todos out of a bundled resource + deleting the source.
- **MED:** `:config` reload fails for a flag-bearing `$EDITOR` (`code --wait`) — `exec.Command` treats the whole string as one binary; VJOURNAL/VFREEBUSY nested-child unencodable; a crash between the `.ics` rename and the sidecar rename loses the Dirty flag (offline edit never synced / delete silently undone — a real Pi/SD-card risk); copy duplicates co-resident bundled todos with their original UIDs.
- **Canary escapes (one test each closes them):** backward-search wrap (`searchNext(-1)`) untested; VTODO PRIORITY `>9` clamp untested; `HasPendingChanges`/`HasLocalChanges` href-less pull-orphan clause untested in the store package.
- **Convergence:** total findings 18→9 (LOW 7→0, MED 6→4) but **HIGH held at 5** and opened a new iron-rule class — **not converged**; the prior "1.0-ready" framing was premature for foreign/bundled `.ics` inputs.
- **Process notes:** the synthesis report over-claimed the repros were "committed" — verified false (they're untracked); corrected the wording. Cleaned up 3 stray canary git worktrees the run left behind. One canary was a no-signal false alarm (its worktree checked out a docs-only commit) — not counted. **No fixes applied yet** — the 5 repro test files are left untracked (they fail `make check`) pending a decision on the fix program; the committed tree stays green.
- Files (committed): `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md`, `docs/audit/passes/PASS-10.md`. Untracked (evidence): `internal/model/{repro_duedur,repro_durnodtstart,emptyvtimezone_repro}_test.go`, `internal/ui/{repro_coresident_move,bundled_copy_repro}_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Tooling: /audit slash-command wrapper for the hardening-audit workflow

- Added `.claude/commands/audit.md` — a thin `/audit` slash command that launches the deterministic `hardening-audit` Workflow, giving the `/`-command ergonomics over the code-driven engine. It parses `$ARGUMENTS` into the workflow's `args` (empty = auto-pick least-audited surfaces; `surface [method]` = one explicit target; `key=value` for `maxTargets`/`maxCanaries`/`skeptics`), calls `Workflow({ name: "hardening-audit", args })`, and on completion relays the residual-risk recommendation, findings-with-repros, canary escapes, and any `ENFORCEMENT` warnings — never a bare "clean". Invoking the command is itself the multi-agent opt-in.
- Updated `docs/audit/PROTOCOL.md` "Running it" to show the `/audit` forms alongside the direct `Workflow(...)` calls.
- Files: `.claude/commands/audit.md`, `docs/audit/PROTOCOL.md`.

## 2026-07-13 — Tooling: coverage-first hardening-audit workflow

- Added a reusable multi-agent audit workflow that enforces the evidence-over-verdict protocol (motivated by a prior pass declaring "1.0-ready" while real HIGH bugs sat in un-audited surfaces). Phases: **Plan** (read the coverage ledger + repo, pick the *least-audited* surfaces) → **Audit** (one method per target: fuzz / fault-injection / race / data-loss / input-edge / spec-diff) → **Verify** (N skeptics refute each finding; survivors must carry a repro the verifier actually ran) → **Canary** (inject known bugs in isolated worktrees; the suite must catch them — tests the net, not the code) → **Report** (coverage-ledger update with explicit blind spots, findings with repros, convergence vs last pass, bounded residual risk). It structurally cannot return "clean" — the recommendation enum is `more_passes_recommended` | `residual_accepted_with_caveats` — and an enforcement gate flags a report missing a ledger, "confirmed" findings without an executed repro, or escaped canaries.
- Read-only on the working tree: audits only read, canaries run in disposable git worktrees, only the final synthesis writes (ledger + `passes/PASS-N.md`).
- Files: `.claude/workflows/hardening-audit.js` (JS workflow; syntax-checked wrapped as the runtime executes it), `docs/audit/PROTOCOL.md` (the rules + stop-rule + how to read output), `docs/audit/COVERAGE.md` (living ledger, seeded with the real pass-1..9 state + declared blind spots), `docs/audit/passes/README.md`.
- Invoke: `Workflow({ name: 'hardening-audit' })` (opt into multi-agent first). Not run here — authored only.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (B2/B4 + audit close-out): CLI password flag guidance

- **B2 (LOW):** the `--password` CLI flag exposes the secret in `ps`/shell history. Kept the flag (dropping it would break documented scripting usage) but its help text now steers users to `$LAZYPLANNER_CALDAV_PASSWORD` and names the exposure. The env var and the config's `password_command` remain the non-exposing paths.
- **B4 (LOW, accepted by design):** `calendar create` slugifies a name to a collection path, and two names differing only in punctuation can slug alike. Left as-is: the server is authoritative on collection paths and rejects a duplicate with a clear error, so no local uniqueness logic is added (which could diverge from the server's own path assumptions).
- This closes out hardening pass 9 (the pre-1.0 audit). Audit items resolved: HIGH H1–H5, MED M1–M6, LOW L5/L6/L8/UI-1/UI-2/B1/B2 + local-read caps, plus the recurrence-mutation fuzz harness. Consciously not changed (documented): L7 (not a bug in practice), B3 (version number = owner's release call), B4 (server-authoritative), Audit-3 UI-3 (already correctly bounds-checked), the `password_command` output size cap (time-bounded; user-owned command).
- Files: `cmd/lazyplanner/conn.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (L-caps): bound local file reads

- Pre-1.0 audit finding (LOW): unlike the CalDAV response body (capped in pass 7), the local reads did an unbounded `os.ReadFile`/`toml.DecodeFile` — so a huge file, or a **symlink to an endless device** (`/dev/zero`) at any of those paths, could OOM or hang the app. Weaker threat model than the network (these are under the user's own dirs), but cheap symmetry.
- **Fix:** every local read now goes through `io.ReadAll(io.LimitReader(f, cap))`: the state file (4 MiB), `config.toml` (4 MiB, read-then-`toml.Decode`), and the sidecar + each `.ics` (64 MiB, mirroring the network cap). An over-cap file reads bounded bytes that then fail to parse and degrade exactly as a corrupt file already does (zero State / non-fatal `LoadError` / actionable config error). (The `password_command` output remains time-bounded by `WaitDelay`; a size cap there was judged unwarranted for a user-owned command.)
- Tests: `internal/state/statecap_test.go` — a state file symlinked to `/dev/zero` returns a zero `State` within a watchdog instead of hanging (skipped where `/dev/zero` is absent). Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/state/state.go`, `internal/store/{sidecar,store}.go`, `internal/config/config.go`, `internal/state/statecap_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (B1): CLI reports unknown commands + adds help/version

- Pre-1.0 audit finding (LOW, CLI UX): an unrecognized first argument fell through to `runTUI()`, so a typo like `lazyplanner imprt` silently opened the TUI (exit 0) instead of reporting the mistake; there was also no `help`/`version`.
- **Fix:** extracted the dispatch into a testable `run(args) int`; `main` is now just `os.Exit(run(...))`. Added `help`/`-h`/`--help` and `version`/`-v`/`--version`, and a default branch that prints `unknown command %q` + usage and exits 2. Replaced `exitOnError` with a code-returning `report`. Added `printUsage`.
- **B3 (version string):** left `appVersion` as the owner's release decision (the project isn't released; per the branch rules I don't bump release identifiers), but `version` now makes it queryable.
- Tests: `cmd/lazyplanner/main_test.go` (new — the package had none) — unknown command → exit 2; help/version → exit 0 without launching the TUI; usage lists every subcommand. README updated with the new subcommands. Full gate passes.
- Files: `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `cmd/lazyplanner/main_test.go`, `README.md`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (UI-1+UI-2): recurrence-edit UI robustness

- Two LOW UI findings from the input-handler audit:
  - **UI-1 — guard the split's empty result:** `grab.go` and `recur_edit.go` indexed `future.Events[0]` after `model.SplitEvent` without a length check. `SplitEvent` always yields one future event so it's currently unreachable, but the TUI must never index into an empty model result (crash-on-model-data rule). Both sites now flash an error and return if `future.Events` is empty. (Defensive guard; no injection seam for a dedicated test.)
  - **UI-2 — keep the drill on delete-occurrence:** deleting/skipping one occurrence of a recurring item goes through the scope picker (a `pageConfirm`, no form), but the shared `commitMutation` still called `closeModal(pageForm)`. Since the picker's own close already restored focus, that second `restoreFocus` popped an empty focus stack and fell through to the Calendars overview — kicking focus off the drilled calendar day (inconsistent with Space-complete). Added `commitMutationKeepingDrill` (extracted `applyMutation` core, uses `refreshKeepingDrill`, no form close) and routed the three delete/skip/this-and-future-delete paths through it.
- Tests: `internal/ui/recuruidrill_test.go` — deleting an occurrence from a drilled calendar grid keeps focus on the grid (not the Calendars overview) and preserves the drill. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/grab.go`, `internal/ui/recur_edit.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/recuruidrill_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (L5+L6): store name-length cap and stale-temp sweep

- Two LOW store-robustness findings, together:
  - **L5 — `SafeName` length cap:** an over-long UID/href (from another client) produced a file name past the filesystem's per-name limit, so that resource silently failed to cache and was retried fruitlessly every sync. `SafeName` now caps the sanitized prefix at `maxSafeNameLen` (200) and appends a deterministic FNV-64 hash suffix — distinct long inputs stay distinct and stable across runs, and the later `.ics` still fits under the common 255-byte limit.
  - **L6 — sweep stale temp files:** `writeFileAtomic` leaves a `.<base>.tmp-*` file if a write is interrupted before its rename. These are never loaded (not `.ics`) but accumulated across crashes (an SD-card concern on the Pi). `loadCalendar` now removes them on open (matched by `isStaleTempName`; real `.ics`/sidecar names never contain `.tmp-`).
- Tests: `internal/store/housekeeping_test.go` — a 1000-char name caps under 255, stays deterministic, and doesn't collide with a different long input; a planted stale temp file is swept on `Open` while the real resource still loads. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/store/mutate.go`, `internal/store/store.go`, `internal/store/housekeeping_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (L8): recurring-todo advance honors RDATE past COUNT=1

- Pre-1.0 audit finding (LOW, edge correctness): `AdvanceRecurringTodo` short-circuited "exhausted" on `roption.Count == 1`, ignoring an RDATE. A COUNT=1 todo that also carries an RDATE has a further occurrence, so completing it marked the whole series done one occurrence early.
- **Fix:** dropped the COUNT-only shortcut and always ask the full recurrence set (RRULE + RDATE − EXDATE) for the next instant via `nextInstantAfter`; exhaustion is now "no next instant". A plain COUNT=1 todo still exhausts correctly (no instant after the anchor); COUNT>1 roll-forward is unchanged.
- Tests: `internal/model/advancerdate_test.go` — a `COUNT=1` + `RDATE` todo advances to the RDATE occurrence instead of completing. Existing advance tests still pass. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/model/recur_edit.go`, `internal/model/advancerdate_test.go`.
- (Related audit item L7 — a `NewSeriesFrom` COUNT clamp "phantom occurrence" — was examined and found **not reachable**: the split point is always an actual occurrence, so the future half legitimately includes it; the clamp yields the correct count. No change.)

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (M6): harden password_command execution

- Pre-1.0 audit findings (MED/LOW): (1) `ResolvePassword` bounded the command with a context timeout but didn't set `Cmd.WaitDelay`, so a command that leaves a grandchild holding stdout open (e.g. one that backgrounds a process) could make `Output`'s internal `Wait` block past the deadline. (2) A command that exited 0 with no output silently produced an **empty password**, surfacing later only as an opaque auth failure.
- **Fix:** set `c.WaitDelay = passwordCommandTimeout` so a lingering child's pipes are force-closed and it's reaped shortly after cancellation; and treat empty trimmed output as an explicit `password_command produced no output` error instead of an empty secret.
- Tests: `internal/config/config_test.go` `TestResolvePassword` gains a failing-command case, an empty-output case, and a bounded-timeout case (returns promptly under a short deadline). Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/config/config.go`, `internal/config/config_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (M5): roll back a failed in-app calendar create

- Pre-1.0 audit finding (MED/LOW): `CreateCalendarLocal` set `s.cals[id]` (with `pendingCreate:true`) and made the directory before writing the sidecar, but did not roll back on a sidecar-write failure. The orphan dir and the in-memory phantom lingered; on the next launch the dir loaded with no sidecar → `pendingCreate=false`, so the calendar was silently never `MKCALENDAR`'d on the server (a non-functional collection).
- **Fix:** on sidecar-write failure, `delete(s.cals, id)` and `os.RemoveAll` the directory — but only when the create actually made it (a `freshDir` stat check first), so a pre-existing directory with content is never destroyed by the rollback. A retry after the transient cause clears now succeeds.
- Tests: `internal/store/createrollback_test.go` — a create whose sidecar write fails leaves no phantom calendar, preserves a pre-existing dir's content, and a subsequent create succeeds. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/store/calendar.go`, `internal/store/createrollback_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (M3): surface a failed revert instead of swallowing it

- Pre-1.0 audit finding (MED): `revertMutation` — invoked when a sidecar write fails, so the disk is likely already failing (ENOSPC/EACCES) — swallowed the result of its own restore write (`_ = writeFileAtomic`, `_ = os.Remove`). If that restore also failed, the on-disk `.ics` kept the failed-edit content while the in-memory + on-disk sidecar held the prior state; on reload the new content loaded as clean, a silent local edit loss / server divergence with no signal to the caller.
- **Fix:** `revertMutation` now returns the restore error (in-memory restore still always runs); the `revert` closure and both callers (`writeResourceLocked`, `remove`) propagate it, and on a double failure return a distinct "cache may be inconsistent until the next successful sync" error (`errors.Join` of the sidecar + revert errors) instead of hiding it. The common single-failure case (revert succeeds) still returns the plain sidecar error and rolls back cleanly.
- Note: a true double failure requires a disk that fails mid-operation (initial write ok → sidecar write fails → revert write fails), which isn't reproducible with static filesystem permissions (initial-write success implies the dir is writable), so it's verified by inspection; the tests cover the single-failure branch selection + reload consistency.
- Tests: `internal/store/revertsurface_test.go` — a sidecar-only failure yields the clean (non-"inconsistent") error and reloads the reverted content clean; existing `rollback_test.go` still passes (regression guard for the refactor). Full gate + `-race` on store pass.
- Files: `internal/store/mutate.go`, `internal/store/revertsurface_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (M2): store.Open degrades when the cache root is unreadable

- Pre-1.0 audit finding (MED): `store.Open` returned a fatal error when `os.ReadDir(<dataDir>/calendars)` failed for any reason other than not-existing (root is a regular file, a symlink to a non-dir, or permission-denied) — locking the user out of the whole app, inconsistent with `loadCalendar`, which records a per-calendar `ReadDir` failure as a `LoadError` and continues.
- **Fix:** a non-`NotExist` root `ReadDir` error is now recorded as a `LoadError` and `Open` returns an empty store (matching the per-calendar tolerance). The UI surfaces the error; a later sync can repopulate. Safe: an empty store carries no tombstones, so this never deletes server data.
- Tests: `internal/store/openrobust_test.go` — opening a dataDir whose `calendars` entry is a regular file yields a non-fatal empty store with the failure in `LoadErrors`. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/store/store.go`, `internal/store/openrobust_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (M1): actionable error on a malformed config.toml

- Pre-1.0 audit finding (MED): a syntax error in `config.toml` aborted startup. Investigated the suggested "fall back to defaults" degradation and **rejected** it: the local cache is namespaced by account (server URL + username), so an unparseable config leaves the account — and thus which cache dir to open — unknown; defaulting would open an empty/wrong-account cache, more confusing than a clear failure. The fatal exit is correct here.
- **Fix:** kept the fatal behavior but made the message actionable — `config %q has a syntax error — fix it and run lazyplanner again: <toml error>` (the toml error already carries line info), and documented the account-cache rationale in-code so it isn't "fixed" into a silent-degrade later.
- Tests: `internal/config/config_test.go` `TestLoadMalformedTOMLIsActionableError` — malformed TOML returns a non-nil error, `configured=false`, and the message names the file. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/config/config.go`, `internal/config/config_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (M4): all-day series cap writes a DATE UNTIL, not DATE-TIME

- Pre-1.0 audit finding (MED, interop, confirmed): `CapSeries` set `roption.Until` and let rrule-go serialize it, which always emits a DATE-TIME (`UNTIL=…T235959Z`). For an all-day (`VALUE=DATE`) master this produced `RRULE:…;UNTIL=20260719T235959Z` against `DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:…`, violating RFC 5545 §3.3.10 (UNTIL's value type must match DTSTART). Expansion worked in-app, but a strict server or another client could reject/mishandle the object on push.
- **Fix:** after `SetRecurrenceRule`, when the master's DTSTART is date-only, rewrite the RRULE's UNTIL token to a DATE via the new `dateOnlyUntil` helper. Timed series are unaffected (still DATE-TIME).
- Tests: `internal/model/recuruntil_test.go` — an all-day series caps to `UNTIL=20260719` (no `T`); a timed series keeps its DATE-TIME UNTIL. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/model/recur_edit.go`, `internal/model/recuruntil_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9: fuzz the recurrence write-side (guards the H2–H5 class)

- The decode-only fuzzers (pass 4) structurally couldn't reach the recurrence *mutation* primitives, which is exactly where pass-9 H2–H5 lived. Added `FuzzRecurrenceMutations` (extending `internal/model/fuzz_test.go` per the "extend, don't fork" rule): for any body that decodes, it drives `AddOccurrenceOverride`, `AddException`, `SplitEvent`, and `AdvanceRecurringTodo`, asserting each (a) never panics and (b) yields an object that re-encodes — so a degenerate rule can't crash the app (H2) and a mutation can't produce an unsaveable object.
- Seeds added (`recurEditSeeds`): the near-zero anchor (H2), an alarmed recurring event (H3/H4), an all-day recurring event (H6), reused alongside the existing `icalSeeds`. Seed corpus runs on the normal gate; `go test -fuzz` explored ~4.8M execs in 26s with **no crash** after the H2–H5 fixes.
- Files: `internal/model/fuzz_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (H5): carry future RECURRENCE-ID overrides across a this-and-future split

- Pre-1.0 audit finding (HIGH, data-loss, confirmed): a this-and-future split lost any per-occurrence customization after the split point. `CapSeries` removes overrides with `rid >= until` from the (past) master half, and `NewSeriesFrom` rebuilt the future half from the master alone — so a `RECURRENCE-ID` override on a *future* occurrence vanished from **both** halves and that occurrence silently reverted to the series default.
- **Fix:** `NewSeriesFrom` now carries forward every override strictly after the split point (`rid > occ`), deep-copied (`deepCopyComponent`, incl. VALARM/nested children) and re-keyed to the new series' UID, so the customization moves with the occurrences it describes. The occurrence at `occ` itself is intentionally not carried — it's redefined by the this-and-future edit. Refactored the H3/H4 child-copy into a general `deepCopyComponent` reused here.
- Tests: `internal/model/recuroverridesplit_test.go` — a weekly series with a customized future occurrence, split before it, keeps that override (its `SUMMARY:custom` and `RECURRENCE-ID`) in the future series under the new UID. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/model/recur_edit.go`, `internal/model/recuroverridesplit_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (H3+H4): preserve VALARM/child components in recurrence overrides & splits

- Pre-1.0 audit finding (HIGH, iron-rule/data-loss, confirmed): the recurrence primitives that **hand-build** a component from a master copied only `master.Props`, never `master.Children` — so a nested `VALARM` (and any other child component) was silently dropped. Two reachable losses: (H3) "edit this occurrence" of an alarmed recurring event (`cloneOverrideComponent`) produced an override with **no reminder**; (H4) "this & future" split (`NewSeriesFrom`) produced a future series with **no reminder on any occurrence**. Root cause: these bypass the encode→decode `clone` round-trip that makes the `editComponent`-based paths iron-rule-safe.
- **Fix:** added `cloneChildren` (recursive deep-copy of child components) and a shared `cloneProp` (deep-copies the param map), and call `cloneChildren(master)` when building the override and the new series. Both now carry the master's VALARMs (and any unknown nested component/params) forward.
- Tests: `internal/model/recurchildren_test.go` — an alarmed recurring event keeps its VALARM (and the alarm's `X-CUSTOM` prop) through both "edit this occurrence" (override has 1 alarm; total 2 across master+override) and "this & future" (future series has 1). Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/model/recur_edit.go`, `internal/model/recurchildren_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (H2): guard write-side recurrence expansion against panics

- Pre-1.0 audit finding (HIGH, reproduced): the recurrence *write* path expanded rules by calling rrule-go directly (`nextInstantAfter` → `set.After`, `occurrencesBefore` → `set.Between`), bypassing the `safeBetween` recover/bound guard the *read* path uses. A degenerate rule — e.g. a near-zero DTSTART year — panics rrule-go's `calcDaySet` (`index out of range [1] with length 0`, confirmed with a throwaway repro), so a malformed recurring item *displayed* fine (read path guarded) then **crashed the live app** on `Space`-complete (`AdvanceRecurringTodo`) or a this-and-future split (`SplitEvent`/`NewSeriesFrom`). Violates "the TUI must never crash on bad .ics data".
- **Fix:** added `safeAfter` (in `recurrence.go`, mirroring `safeBetween`: same panic-recover + `maxOccurrenceSteps` bound, matching `set.After(after, inc)` within the bound). `nextInstantAfter` now uses `safeAfter` and degrades to "no next occurrence" on a panic; `occurrencesBefore` now uses `safeBetween` and degrades to 0. Both are the same graceful fallback the read path already takes. Confirmed these were the only two unguarded rrule expansions in `internal/model`.
- Tests: `internal/model/recurpanic_test.go` — `AdvanceRecurringTodo` and `SplitEvent` on a near-zero-anchor recurring item complete without panicking (the pre-fix repro). Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/model/recurrence.go`, `internal/model/recur_edit.go`, `internal/model/recurpanic_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 9 (H1): neutralize path-traversal calendar ids (data-loss fix)

- Pre-1.0 audit finding (HIGH, verified): `store.SafeName` allowed `.` and `..` through unchanged, so a calendar id of `..` — reachable by typing `..` as a calendar name (`internal/ui/calendar.go` → `SafeName`) **or** from a hostile/buggy server collection href ending in `/..` (`sync.collectionID` guarded `"."` but not `".."`) — became a traversal segment joined onto the cache root. Create-then-delete such a calendar ran `RemoveCalendarLocal` → `os.RemoveAll(filepath.Join(root, ".."))`, which resolves to the **entire account data directory** (all calendars + state file). Confirmed the reachability trace end-to-end.
- **Fix (chokepoint + defense-in-depth):** `SafeName` now maps a result of exactly `"."`/`".."` to `"unnamed"` (legitimate names never sanitize to a bare dot-segment; `.ics` resource names are unaffected since they carry an extension). Added `validCalendarID` (rejects empty, `.`, `..`, or any `/`\`\x00`) and gated the three store paths that join a calendar id onto the root — `ensureCalendar`, `CreateCalendarLocal`, and (above all) `RemoveCalendarLocal`. `sync.collectionID` now also folds `".."` into the `"calendar"` fallback.
- Tests: `internal/store/pathsafety_test.go` — `SafeName` never yields a traversal/empty element; `RemoveCalendarLocal("..")` refuses and a sentinel file beside the calendars root survives (the catastrophe guard); `CreateCalendarLocal` rejects unsafe ids. `internal/sync/collectionid_internal_test.go` — traversal collection paths fold to `"calendar"`, normal paths keep their safe segment. Full gate (test/vet/staticcheck) passes.
- Files: `internal/store/mutate.go`, `internal/store/calendar.go`, `internal/sync/import.go`, + the two new tests.

## 2026-07-13 — Pre-1.0: best-effort push-flush on quit

- Closed the "edit then immediately quit" gap: previously pressing `q` stopped instantly and only cancelled work (`a.cancel()` + `stopSyncTimer`), so a local edit made inside the 3s debounce window — or while briefly offline — sat unpushed in the cache until the next launch (data-safe, but other devices didn't see it until reopen).
- **New `flushOnQuit`** (`internal/ui/app.go`): after the TUI stops (terminal restored — so it prints a plain notice and can't deadlock the event loop), it best-effort pushes pending changes. It's a **no-op when offline** (`syncFn == nil`) **or nothing is pending** (new `store.HasPendingChanges`), so quit stays instant in the common case; it uses its **own** context (so shutdown's `a.cancel()` doesn't abort it) with a **hard timeout** (`defaultQuitFlushTimeout` = 10s) enforced via a select/watchdog, so even a `syncFn` that ignores context cancellation can't trap the user (the process is exiting; a stuck goroutine is harmless). Nothing is ever lost — unpushed edits persist and sync next launch. Wired into `Run`: background workers are stopped (`cancel`+`stopSyncTimer`) before the flush so they don't race it; skipped on a TUI error.
- **`store.HasPendingChanges`** (`internal/store/calendar.go`): store-wide check — true for a dirty/never-pushed resource, a tombstone, or a pending calendar create/delete/rename/recolor (the per-calendar `HasLocalChanges` missed the calendar-level pending flags). Read-only, additive.
- Tests: `internal/ui/quitflush_test.go` — offline no-op, nothing-pending no-call (quit stays instant), pending → one bounded sync call with a deadline, sync-error note, and the **timeout watchdog** (a 2s-sleeping syncFn returns within a 100ms injected timeout). `internal/store/pending_test.go` — `HasPendingChanges` across all pending kinds + clean cases. Full gate + `-race` on ui/store pass; release binary builds.
- Files: `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/store/calendar.go`, `internal/ui/quitflush_test.go`, `internal/store/pending_test.go`, docs (`README.md`, `main.md`, `CLAUDE.md`).

## 2026-07-13 — Pre-1.0: reorder the bottom help bar (help/quit first, then movement)

- Cosmetic, non-breaking. The help bar is still a single hardcoded string with wrap off, so a narrow terminal clips the right end. Reordered it so the two most important hints — `? help` (reveals the full keymap) and `q quit` — lead and survive clipping, followed by the basic movement/navigation a new user needs (`hjkl move · Enter open · Esc back · c/t/a panes · f/b prev/next · v view · [ ] cal · { } list`), then the editing actions, then the rest. Also newly surfaces `hjkl`/`Enter`/`Esc` on the bar (they weren't listed before). No behavior change; the `?` overlay remains the full reference.
- Tests: `internal/ui/hints_test.go` — asserts `? help · q quit` leads and the intended token order holds, plus the `comp:on/off` toggle. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/hints_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 8: exhaustive timezone/DST recurrence sweep (no bug found; regression guards added)

- Recurrence + DST is a classic bug farm, so swept it exhaustively (`internal/model/tzsweep_test.go`), first observing the model's actual output on the hard cases, then pinning the observed-correct behavior. All assertions are on the **local wall-clock** time (the user-facing truth, and the property that must survive an offset change).
- Cases, all **passing** (behavior confirmed correct): daily/weekly wall-clock preserved across the US spring-forward and fall-back; southern-hemisphere DST (Australia/Sydney, opposite direction); half-hour-offset zone (Australia/Adelaide); leap-day `FREQ=YEARLY` recurs only on leap years (2024/2028/2032, not normalized); `FREQ=MONTHLY` on the 31st skips short months; year-boundary daily; UTC (no shift); floating time interpreted in loc; Windows/Outlook zone name (`Eastern Standard Time`) resolved via the CLDR map; all-day weekly stays date-only on the right dates across DST.
- The two hard cases are pinned by `TestTZSweepGapAndFold`: a **spring-forward gap** time (02:30 on the skip day) and a **fall-back ambiguous** time (01:30, which occurs twice) each yield exactly one occurrence on each expected day — no crash, drop, or duplicate. (The gap-day instant is an hour off, a benign zone-arithmetic quirk in the underlying library; the invariant that matters — one-per-day, no error — holds.)
- No product code changed; the sweep is a permanent regression guard on the normal gate. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 7: network fault-injection — cap response bodies, verify clean degradation

- Hardened the CalDAV network trust boundary against a hostile/buggy/compromised server.
- **Fix — response body size cap:** the four own-XML PROPFIND parsers (colors, ctag, privileges, listobjects) and go-webdav's calendar-data reads all did an unbounded `xml.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(...)` / decode, so a server streaming an unbounded (or enormous) body could hang a sync or exhaust memory — a real risk on the Pi. Added a `cappingTransport` on the shared HTTP client (so it covers both go-webdav's requests and our own): every response body is bounded at `maxResponseBodyBytes` (64 MiB, far above any real listing), and exceeding it fails the request with an explicit error rather than silently truncating. A bulk download that trips it falls back to per-resource fetches (pass-3 #2); a metadata PROPFIND that trips it just degrades (best-effort).
- **Tests — hostile responses** (`internal/caldav/hostile_test.go`): an oversized/streaming body makes the call fail (bounded read) within a watchdog instead of hanging; malformed XML, non-XML bytes, an empty 207, 500/401 statuses, a Content-Length-lying truncated body, and a 5000-deep nested document each return an error without panicking or hanging (the deep-nest case confirms no stack overflow in the XML decode).
- **Tests — sync fault propagation** (`internal/sync/fault_test.go`): a discovery failure surfaces as a clean error without mutating the cache; a transient push failure leaves the local edit intact and still dirty (never marked clean or dropped) and it pushes cleanly once the server recovers. (Per-calendar reconcile failures were already record-and-continue from passes 2–3.)
- Files: `internal/caldav/client.go` (+`hostile_test.go`), `internal/sync/sync_test.go` (fake gained `discoverErr`), `internal/sync/fault_test.go`. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 6: terminal/display robustness stress pass (no bug found; regression guards added)

- Targeted the layer with the worst historical track record — the six custom-drawn widgets (`calendarView`, `timeGridView`, `agendaBoard`, `colorPicker`, the mode indicator, `caretForm`), which previously produced two freeze bugs (draw-deadlock and the tree infinite-loop). Method mirrors the fuzz passes: drive display-hostile content through every draw path across a matrix of terminal geometries and assert no `Draw` panics or hangs (a panic in a draw path crashes the live app).
- **New stress tests** (`internal/ui/displaystress_test.go`), each drawing on a `SimulationScreen` with a panic-recover + 5s watchdog:
  - `TestDisplayStress` — drives every mode/view (tasks, calendar month/week/day, drilled, agenda) with hostile content (3000-char titles; double-width CJK/emoji; zero-width combining marks; RTL; control chars; regional-indicator flag pairs; 150 same-day events; a 30-deep subtask chain; 300 flat tasks) and draws the whole layout at geometries from **1×1 to 400×150**.
  - `TestMonthGridDrillScrollStress` / `TestTimeGridDrillScrollStress` — drive each grid's `InputHandler` directly (the real drill path, which the app forwards to the focused primitive) to the far index over 150 hostile items, then draw at 1–3-row heights — the scroll-window / "+N more" math at its extreme, including hour-zoom pushed to the max.
  - `TestEditFormStress`, `TestColorPickerStress` — the popup draw paths over a 3000-char/emoji prefill.
- **Result: no panic or hang found** — the custom widgets handle rune-width, clipping, and scroll boundaries correctly even at 1×1 with double-width content at the far scroll index. The value is the permanent regression guards: any future draw-path panic/hang (the historical freeze-bug classes) now fails the normal gate. Confirmed `SimulationScreen` honors 1×1 so the boundary math is genuinely exercised.
- No product code changed; full gate (test/vet/staticcheck) passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/displaystress_test.go` (new).

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 5: batched bulk pull — initial sync/import now O(N), not O(N²)

- A scale benchmark (`internal/sync/scale_bench_test.go`, `BenchmarkInitialSyncPull`) confirmed a **quadratic** first-time sync/import: n=100→9ms, n=400→89ms, n=1000→457ms. Cause: every pulled resource went through `writeResourceLocked`, which re-serialized and atomically rewrote the **whole** calendar's sidecar — so N pulls × O(N) sidecar each = O(N²) work and disk bytes (brutal on a Pi's SD card, where every write also fsyncs).
- **Fix:** new `store.PullRemoteBatch` writes each `.ics` atomically but the sidecar **once** per calendar. Sync's step (B) "new on server" loop and `Import` collect their pulls and apply them in one batch. After: n=100→3.4ms, n=400→12.4ms, n=1000→29.7ms — **linear** (~15× faster at n=1000). Refactored the write core into `stageResourceLocked` (write `.ics` + in-memory, defer sidecar) shared by the single-write path and the batch.
- **Crash safety (the delicate part):** the batch is pull-only and holds `s.mu` for its whole duration, so a concurrent UI edit is fully serialized (never interleaved/lost — the pass-3 #3 hazard) and all writes are unconditional (no clobber). A crash mid-batch can leave an `.ics` whose sidecar entry wasn't flushed — a "pull orphan" that reloads clean and href-less. Reconcile step (A) now recognizes that state (`Href=="" && !Dirty`, which a genuine local create never is — those are dirty) and **does not re-upload it** (which would create a server-side duplicate); step (B) re-pulls the server's copy over it, healing it. If the server no longer has it, it stays an inert local item rather than being resurrected on the server.
- Tests: `internal/sync/orphan_test.go` — a pull orphan is healed by re-pull with **0 PUTs** (no duplicate), and an orphan the server lacks is still never pushed. Full gate + `-race` on sync/store pass.
- Files: `internal/store/{mutate,remote}.go`, `internal/sync/{sync,import}.go`, `internal/sync/{orphan,scale_bench}_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 5: BuildTree is now linear, not quadratic

- `BenchmarkBuildTree` showed the subtask-forest build was **O(N²)**: n=100→36µs, n=1000→3.5ms, n=5000→**93ms** (per reload — and it runs on every tree reload). Cause: the per-insert `descends()` cycle guard walked the parent's entire current subtree, summing to O(N²) when many tasks share few parents.
- **Fix:** replaced the subtree walk with `classifyByAncestry` — a memoized, iterative parent-chain classification that marks each UID as either reaching a real root or trapped in a cycle, in linear total time (iterative, so a deep chain can't overflow the stack either). Behavior is **unchanged**: nodes reachable only through a cycle are still dropped (per the `TestBuildTreeBreaksCycles`/`TestBuildTreeCycleWithExtraChild` contract), duplicates and UID-less todos handled as before. After: n=5000→**2.35ms** (~40× faster) and cleanly linear.
- Tests: existing tree tests + `FuzzBuildTree` (re-fuzzed 40s clean) cover the preserved semantics; `internal/model/scale_test.go` adds the benchmark. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/model/tree.go`, `internal/model/scale_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 5: bound recurrence expansion (scale + malformed-input safeguard)

- Scale review found `Event.Occurrences` had **no cap** on how many instances it materialized, and it runs on the render path. A syntactically valid but pathological rule — `FREQ=SECONDLY` with no COUNT/UNTIL (≈2.6M instances over a month view), or a rule anchored centuries before the window (an unbounded skip-forward) — would freeze the UI or exhaust memory. Reachable from a malformed/adversarial `.ics`, so this is a robustness/DoS bug as much as a scale one; the pass-4 fuzz harness structurally couldn't catch it (a huge-but-successful expansion trips neither the no-error nor no-panic assertion).
- **Fix:** `safeBetween` now iterates the rrule set manually (via `Set.Iterator()`) with two bounds — `maxOccurrenceSteps` (~1M raw steps, incl. skipped) and `maxOccurrencesPerEvent` (10000 collected) — so a pathological rule returns promptly with a bounded result instead of hanging. Within the bounds the output is identical to `set.Between`. (The existing panic-recover for degenerate rrule iteration is kept.)
- Tests (`internal/model/scale_test.go`): a `FREQ=SECONDLY` event and a far-anchored `FREQ=MINUTELY` event both expand within a 10s watchdog and return a capped count; `FuzzEventOccurrences` re-fuzzed 45s clean. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/model/recurrence.go`, `internal/model/scale_test.go`.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 4: fuzz the iCalendar ingest boundary — contain library panics

- Started a **fuzz pass** over LazyPlanner's input trust boundary (the decision to address fuzzing now: the app ingests arbitrary iCalendar from any other CalDAV client and any server response, yet had **zero** fuzz tests — the single largest robustness surface, and pass-3 already proved it harbors real bugs). Added native Go fuzz targets in `internal/model/fuzz_test.go`: `FuzzDecode` (decode → Encode → re-decode round-trip), `FuzzEventOccurrences` (recurrence expansion), `FuzzBuildTree` (subtask forest from a fuzzed topology), `FuzzParseQuickAdd` (smart parser). `go test` runs the seed corpus (incl. every saved crasher) on the normal gate; `go test -fuzz` explores.
- **Two crash bugs found and contained** (both violated the iron rule "the TUI must never crash on a bad server response or malformed .ics"):
  - **go-ical decoder panic** — its line decoder indexes past the buffer (`peek()` with no `empty()` guard) on a content line ending mid-parameter (e.g. `PROP;X=`), panicking instead of erroring. A malformed `.ics` on disk **or a hostile/buggy server response** (go-webdav decodes calendar-data with the same decoder) would crash the whole app. Contained at both byte→calendar boundaries: `model.decodeCalendar` (recover → error; covers the store load + conflict re-parse paths) and `internal/caldav`'s new `guardICalPanic` around `QueryCalendar`/`GetCalendarObject` (a bulk-query panic surfaces as a `DownloadAll` error, which sync already falls back from to per-resource fetches, so one poison object is skipped, not fatal).
  - **rrule-go iteration panic** — `Set.Between`→`calcDaySet` panics (index out of range) expanding some degenerate rules (e.g. a near-zero DTSTART year). `Event.Occurrences` now iterates via `safeBetween` (recover) and degrades to the event's base instance — the same graceful fallback it already uses for a rule that fails to *build*.
- Vendored code is never hand-edited (per CLAUDE.md); both fixes live at our own call boundaries.
- Tests: `internal/model/harden_ingest_test.go` (`TestDecodeContainsDecoderPanic`, `TestOccurrencesDegradeOnRrulePanic`); `internal/caldav/guardpanic_test.go` (guard converts the real go-ical decode panic to an error; passes a normal error through). Saved crashers under `internal/model/testdata/fuzz/`. Full gate + all four fuzzers clean (FuzzDecode 18.5M execs / 3 min).
- Files: `internal/model/{decode,recurrence}.go`, `internal/caldav/client.go`, tests + fuzz corpus.

## 2026-07-13 — Hardening pass 4: heal decode-but-unencodable iCalendar on ingest

- `FuzzDecode`'s round-trip invariant (anything that decodes must re-encode, so anything LazyPlanner can display it can also save) surfaced a class of **"loaded but uneditable"** bugs: go-ical's decoder is tolerant but its **encoder** is strict, so an item that parsed fine could fail to re-encode — and since every edit re-encodes the whole resource (`editComponent`→`clone`→`Encode`, and `store.writeResource`), that hard-failed the edit **and blocked editing every sibling in the same resource**. Downloads already re-encode (so the server can't inject these — they're rejected as a skip), but a `.ics` written by another vdir tool (vdirsyncer/khal) or hand-edited reaches the cache and displays.
- **Healed at ingest** (`model.Parse`, mirroring how `resolveDateTime` recovers an unknown TZID — add only what's missing, never mangle existing props, so the iron rule holds):
  - **Missing DTSTAMP** (`ensureDTStamp`) — synthesized from LAST-MODIFIED/CREATED, else a fixed epoch; a real edit's `touch()` overwrites it, so the placeholder rarely persists.
  - **Missing VERSION/PRODID** on the VCALENDAR (`ensureCalendarProps`) — LazyPlanner's own, only when absent (an existing PRODID naming another producer is preserved).
  - **Duplicate single-valued properties** (`dedupeSingleValued`, e.g. two UIDs) — drop all but the first (the one `text()`/typed parsing already read), via a table mirroring go-ical's encoder cardinality rules for the component types we emit.
  - **Raw CR/LF in a property value** (`sanitizePropValues`) — stripped; a real line break is the two-char escape `\n`, so a raw control char is structural corruption, never content.
  - **Illegally nested components** (`stripForbiddenNesting`, e.g. a VTODO inside a VTODO) — dropped; only VALARM may nest under VEVENT/VTODO (STANDARD/DAYLIGHT under VTIMEZONE), and a mis-nested item is unaddressable anyway.
- A UID-less component is **not** given a fabricated UID (that would churn identity under sync — pass-3 #7 deliberately keeps such todos display-only), so it remains the one documented non-round-trippable case. The remaining go-ical *semantic* encoder constraints (DUE+DURATION / DTEND+DURATION mutual exclusion, empty VCALENDAR, VTIMEZONE-needs-a-child) are not auto-healed — extremely low reachability (the fuzzer ran clean past them) — left as a documented follow-up.
- Tests: `TestDecodeHealsForEditability` (a DTSTAMP/VERSION/PRODID-less todo decodes, re-encodes, edits, and keeps an unknown `X-` prop), `TestDecodeDedupesAndStripsToEncodable` (two UIDs → first kept; nested VTODO + the rest re-encode). All existing tests unaffected (heals are no-ops on well-formed fixtures). Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/model/decode.go`, `internal/model/harden_ingest_test.go` (+ fuzz corpus).

## 2026-07-12 — Session wrap-up: entering continuous hardening/audit phase

- End-of-day checkpoint. All 13 build steps are complete; the project is now explicitly in a **continuous hardening & audit phase** — bug-hunting, resilience, and consistency, not new features. Next session picks up with **continued auditing**.
- This session's hardening: three audit passes (promised-vs-implemented gaps; consistency; deep debugging — 9 adversarially-verified defects fixed, including sync-core data-loss/TOCTOU races), plus a concurrent `-race` stress test and an opt-in live CalDAV suite verified against the NextCloud test account. All on `ai-workspace`, pushed; nothing merged to `main`.
- **Next / not yet audited:** large-calendar performance/scale, and the Raspberry Pi target on real hardware.
- Docs updated to record the phase: `main.md` (Status, Current State, new "Hardening & audit phase" note), `CLAUDE.md` (Project Context phase line + live/`-race` test conventions), this `log.md` entry.

## 2026-07-12 — Live CalDAV integration tests (opt-in, real server)

- Added `internal/sync/live_test.go` behind a `//go:build live` tag (excluded from the normal build/gate). It reads the configured account via `config.Load` (no secret on the command line) and operates only inside a throwaway calendar it creates and deletes via `t.Cleanup` — never touching a pre-existing calendar.
- Verified **live against the owner's NextCloud test account** (`test_user@cloud.litteken-server.com`), all passing, throwaway calendars cleaned up:
  - `TestLiveDiscover` — discovery walk + the three side-channel PROPFINDs: colors (truecolor hex), CTags (all present), and privileges (the `contact_birthdays` calendar correctly detected read-only); component-set parsing (VEVENT vs VTODO).
  - `TestLiveRoundTrip` — full two-way sync: local create → push → confirmed on server; edit → push → confirmed; the **CTag incremental short-circuit** engaging on an idle repeat sync; delete → push → confirmed gone.
  - `TestLiveCalendarProps` — a calendar rename + recolor `PROPPATCH` round-trip, confirmed by re-discovery (server-authoritative name/color).
  - `TestLiveConflict` — a resource edited both locally and directly on the server syncs to a recorded keep-both conflict (server version stashed, not flagged deleted, no silent overwrite).
- Documented the opt-in suite in the README Development section. The normal `make check` gate is unaffected (build-tag excluded; staticcheck/vet clean).
- Files: `internal/sync/live_test.go` (new), `README.md`.

## 2026-07-12 — Hardening pass 3: concurrent sync-vs-edits stress test (-race)

- Added `TestConcurrentSyncAndEditsRace` (`internal/sync/sync_test.go`): the real scenario the compare-and-set writeback (#3) guards — a background goroutine looping `sync.Sync` while 4 goroutines hammer `store.Put` on the same resources (1000 edits/run). Previous #3 test only *simulated* the interleaving synchronously; this drives genuine goroutine concurrency so `-race` has something to inspect.
- Asserts: no data race (detector), no panic/deadlock (completes), and post-quiesce integrity — every seeded resource still present, parseable, carrying its own UID (no torn/mixed body), and a fresh `store.Open` of the same dir reloads the identical consistent set with zero load errors (proves concurrent sync + edits never leave the `.ics`/sidecar inconsistent or drop a resource).
- Each editor Puts pre-built per-goroutine `*model.Parsed` copies so no object is shared across goroutines — isolating the store's own locking as the thing under test. Passes under `go test -race -count=5`.
- Files: `internal/sync/sync_test.go` (test-only; added a `stdsync "sync"` alias). Full gate + race pass.

## 2026-07-12 — Hardening pass 3 (#2): one bad resource no longer stalls a whole calendar's download

- **Bug:** `DownloadAll` runs go-webdav's bulk calendar-query, whose `decodeCalendarObjectList` returns on the **first** resource whose iCalendar won't decode. So a single corrupt/truncated `.ics` made the whole calendar's download fail; `reconcileCalendar` recorded the entire calendar as one skip and none of its other (healthy) resources synced — every sync, until the bad item was fixed server-side. This contradicted the documented per-resource resilience (the decode happens in the transport before the app sees individual objects, so the per-item skip in `pullInto`/`model.Parse` never got a chance).
- **Fix:** new caldav `ListObjectHrefs` (a Depth-1 PROPFIND for `getetag`/`resourcetype`, no calendar-data → can't fail on a bad body) + a shared `downloadResilient` helper: on a bulk-download failure it enumerates hrefs and `GetObject`s each resource individually, skipping (and recording) only the ones that won't fetch/decode. Wired into both two-way sync (`downloadCalendar`) and one-way `Import`. The fallback records a skip so the slower degraded path isn't invisible (no silent truncation).
- Tests: `internal/sync/sync_test.go` — a failed bulk download falls back, syncs the good resource, and skips the bad one (via new `onPut`-style `getErr`/`failDownload`/`ListObjectHrefs` fakes); `internal/caldav/listobjects_test.go` — the PROPFIND parse excludes the collection and returns members with unquoted ETags. `Import`'s and `Sync`'s doc comments now match reality.
- Files: `internal/caldav/listobjects.go` (new, +test), `internal/sync/{sync,import}.go`, `internal/sync/{sync,import}_test.go`. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-12 — Hardening pass 3 (#9): a concurrent calendar rename/recolor survives its PROPPATCH

- **Bug (metadata loss):** `pushCalendarProps` snapshotted the pending name/color, ran the network `SetCalendarProps` PROPPATCH, then `MarkCalendarPropsSynced` cleared `pendingName`/`pendingColor` **unconditionally**. If the user renamed/recolored the same calendar during the round-trip, the flag was cleared even though the value had changed — so the new value never re-pushed, and the next discovery's `SyncCalendarName`/`SyncCalendarColor` (which skip only while pending) then adopted the server's *older* value, overwriting the local edit. Silent metadata loss.
- **Fix:** `MarkCalendarPropsSynced` now takes the pushed name/color and clears a flag only if the field still equals what was PROPPATCHed; a concurrent change leaves the flag set so it re-pushes and the server value can't clobber it.
- Test (`internal/store/pendingflags_test.go`): rename B pushed, rename C lands mid-PROPPATCH, mark-synced(B) leaves C pending, and a discovery pull of B doesn't overwrite C.
- Files: `internal/store/calendar.go`, `internal/sync/sync.go`, `internal/store/pendingflags_test.go`. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-12 — Hardening pass 3 (#4): keep-server can't misread an unparseable version as a deletion

- **Bug (silent local-edit loss):** `stashServerConflict` swallowed `model.Parse`/`Encode` errors, so a server version that ical-decodes but fails our stricter model (e.g. a VEVENT missing DTSTART written by another client) stashed with **empty** `ServerData`. `ResolveKeepServer` used `ServerData == ""` as the *sole* signal for "server deleted" → keep-server `Forget`s the local copy. So a present-but-unparseable server version was indistinguishable from a real deletion, and choosing "keep server" silently discarded the local edit with the server version never captured — a keep-both iron-rule violation.
- **Fix:** added an explicit `ServerDeleted` flag to the conflict (sidecar + `Conflict` + `MarkConflict`), set only on a genuine server deletion; `ResolveKeepServer` now branches on it, never on empty `ServerData`. `stashServerConflict` encodes the decoded server calendar **directly** (not via a typed re-parse) so an unparseable version is still preserved losslessly, and records a skip. Keep-server on an unparseable version now errors (surfaced) and leaves the local edit intact instead of deleting it; a truly empty non-deletion also refuses rather than dropping data.
- Tests (`internal/sync/sync_test.go`): a both-edited conflict whose server version lacks DTSTART is not flagged deleted, stashes the raw version, and keep-server errors without discarding the local edit. Updated the `MarkConflict` signature in store/ui conflict tests.
- Files: `internal/store/{conflict,sidecar}.go`, `internal/sync/sync.go`, tests in `internal/store`, `internal/ui`, `internal/sync`. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-12 — Hardening pass 3 (#3): sync writeback can't clobber a concurrent edit

- **Bug (silent lost update):** `pushUpdate`/`pushCreate` encode the pre-sync snapshot, run a slow network PUT, then wrote that *same stale snapshot* back as clean (`PutRemote`). Sync runs on a background goroutine while the UI keeps editing on the event loop, so an edit that lands during the in-flight PUT was reverted on disk + in memory **and** marked clean (never pushed) — the edit was irrecoverably lost, no conflict raised. The 3s debounced push (fires while the user is still typing) makes the window reachable. `pullInto` had the same clobber pattern against a concurrent edit during reconcile.
- **Fix (compare-and-set):** every resource mutation swaps in a fresh `*Resource` (copy-on-write), so pointer identity is the concurrency signal. New store `CommitPush` adopts the server ETag+clean state only if the current resource is still the exact one that was pushed; if a concurrent edit replaced it, that newer content is kept **dirty** with the ETag baseline advanced to the server's value (next push is conditional on it — no revert, no lost update, no duplicate). New `PullRemote` takes an `expectedPrev` and skips the pull if a concurrent edit replaced it (leaving it to reconcile as a conflict next sync); read-only/server-authoritative pulls pass `nil` (unconditional). Refactored `writeResource` to expose a lock-held core (`writeResourceLocked`) shared by all three.
- Tests (`internal/sync/sync_test.go`): a concurrent edit injected mid-PUT (new `onPut` fake hook) survives, stays dirty, and adopts the new ETag baseline — instead of being reverted to the pushed snapshot. Also verified under `go test -race`.
- Files: `internal/store/mutate.go`, `internal/store/remote.go`, `internal/sync/sync.go`, `internal/sync/sync_test.go`. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-12 — Hardening pass 3 (#8): skip server objects with an empty href

- **Bug:** a CalDAV response carrying an empty `<href/>` decoded to an object with `Path==""`. Reconcile step B didn't match it in `localByHref` and pulled it, storing it with `Href==""`; the **next** sync's step A then saw `r.Href == ""`, classified it as a never-pushed local resource, and `pushCreate`'d it — a spurious server-side duplicate from a malformed/buggy server response.
- **Fix:** step B now skips any server object with an empty `Path`, recording it (`errEmptyHref`) instead of storing an unaddressable resource.
- Test (`internal/sync/sync_test.go`): an empty-href server object is skipped (recorded, 0 pulled, 0 stored, 0 puts) rather than stored and re-uploaded.
- Files: `internal/sync/sync.go`, `internal/sync/sync_test.go`. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-12 — Hardening pass 3 (#7): UID-less todos no longer collapse in the tree

- **Bug:** `BuildTree` keyed nodes by `Todo.UID`. A VTODO with no UID (malformed — UID is RFC 5545-required but nothing enforces it on read) hashed to the shared `""` slot: every UID-less todo overwrote `nodes[""]`, so only the **last** survived the map, and the roots loop then resolved each UID-less todo to that same node and appended it repeatedly — some tasks vanished, one duplicated. (A duplicate *non-empty* UID had a milder version of the same double-append.)
- **Fix:** UID-less todos are no longer keyed in the map; each gets its own standalone root node so all surface exactly once. A `placed` set ensures a duplicate non-empty UID places its node once.
- Tests (`internal/model/tree_test.go`): two UID-less todos + a keyed one produce three distinct roots (each once); a duplicate UID places one node.
- Files: `internal/model/tree.go`, `internal/model/tree_test.go`. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-12 — Hardening pass 3 (#6): beginGrabFuture rolls back a half-completed split

- **Bug:** a this-and-future grab writes the split as two `store.Put`s — cap the master, then write the new future series. If the **first** succeeded and the **second** failed, `beginGrabFuture` flashed an error and returned with the master already capped (tail occurrences dropped), the future series never written, `grabbing` still false (so `cancelGrab`'s two-resource revert could never run), and no undo step pushed — the later occurrences were lost with no in-session recovery.
- **Fix:** on the second `Put` failing, `Restore` the master from `loc.Prev` before returning, so the split can't half-complete. Both error paths now use `flashErr("Grab", err)`.
- Test (`internal/ui/recur_edit_test.go`): after capping the master, `Restore(loc.Prev)` (the exact rollback the fix performs) brings the master back to its full 4 occurrences. (A real mid-operation write failure can't be induced deterministically — the new series' resource name uses a random UID — so the test exercises the recovery call directly; the live two-resource revert stays covered by `TestGrabFutureCancelRestores`.)
- Files: `internal/ui/grab.go`, `internal/ui/recur_edit_test.go`. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-12 — Hardening pass 3 (#5): mouse can't bypass grab/resize modal gating

- **Bug:** `mouseCapture` guarded only on `modalOpen()` (an overlay page). Grab mode (`a.grabbing`) and the `Ctrl-W` resize sub-mode (`a.resizing`) are flag-only modal states with no overlay page, so the mouse was **not** swallowed during them: a click still fired `setMode` (switching the active pane) and a double-click still opened the edit form — two modal states coexisting, and grab reading the wrong `a.mode`. The keyboard path already gated on both flags.
- **Fix:** `mouseCapture` now swallows the event (`return nil, action`) when `a.grabbing || a.resizing`, matching the keyboard gating.
- Test (`internal/ui/mouse_test.go`): a click during each flag-state is swallowed and does not switch mode.
- Files: `internal/ui/mouse.go`, `internal/ui/mouse_test.go`. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-12 — Hardening pass 3 (#10): Space on an event always gives feedback

- Key-contract fix (owner's explicit Pass-3 rule: a used key must act or flash, never a silent no-op).
- **Bug:** `toggleComplete` early-returned silently when the target was not a task. In Calendar mode Space pre-handles the event case ("Can't complete an event") in its own switch, but in **Agenda** (and Tasks) mode Space routes straight to `toggleComplete`, so pressing it on an event did nothing with no feedback — inconsistent with Calendar mode.
- **Fix:** `toggleComplete` now flashes `Can't complete an event` for a non-task target and `Select a task first` when nothing is selected. Calendar mode still pre-empts both cases, so no double message.
- Test (`internal/ui/lowfixes_test.go`): Space on an Agenda event flashes the event message.
- Files: `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/lowfixes_test.go`. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-12 — Hardening pass 3 (#1): malformed recurrence can't blank the calendar

- Deep debugging/hardening audit (multi-agent fan-out, adversarially verified) fix #1 of the confirmed set — the one **high**-severity finding.
- **Bug:** a cached VEVENT with a syntactically valid but semantically bad recurrence (`RRULE:FREQ=NONSENSE`, unknown key, wrong VALUE type) loads cleanly (RRULE isn't parsed at load) but errors at expansion time. `Event.Occurrences` → `Parsed.EventOccurrences` → `store.EventOccurrencesVisible` all returned on the first error, and the UI discards it (`occs, _ :=`), so a single bad event **blanked every event in every calendar** across month/week/day/agenda until the offending `.ics` was removed — a clear iron-rule (graceful-degradation) violation.
- **Fix:** degrade at the source — a recurrence that can't be built now falls back to the event's single **base instance** at DTSTART (`Event.baseInstance`), so the event stays visible, just un-expanded, instead of propagating a fatal error. Added defense-in-depth skip-and-continue at both aggregation loops (`Parsed.EventOccurrences` master loop, `store.EventOccurrencesVisible`) so no future expansion error can blank siblings/other calendars.
- Tests (`internal/model/recurrence_test.go`): a malformed-RRULE event yields its base instance (no error); a file with one bad + one good event surfaces both.
- Files: `internal/model/recurrence.go`, `internal/store/store.go`, `internal/model/recurrence_test.go`. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-12 — Hardening pass 2: consistency across the program

- A deep consistency audit (fan-out over error-handling/messaging, UI cross-view, model/store API, sync/caldav patterns, coding standards) confirmed high consistency; fixed the real divergences (owner decided the forks).
- **Sync 403 handling (the headline fix)**: `pushDelete` trusted a bare 403 (flag read-only, resurrect the item, drop the tombstone → delete never retried) while create/update re-check privileges. Added `handleDeleteForbidden` (the delete twin of `handleWriteForbidden`): a transient/unconfirmed 403 keeps the tombstone and records a skip to retry; only a *confirmed* read-only calendar discards. `pushDelete` now takes the calendar path for the re-check.
- **Sync record-and-continue**: per-calendar metadata writes (SetCalendarMeta/ReadOnly/Components/Sync{Color,Name}) in the discovery loop now `recordSkip`+`continue` instead of `return`-aborting the whole run — matching reconcile.
- **Cancellable password command**: `config.ResolvePassword` now takes a `context.Context` and uses `exec.CommandContext` with a 10s timeout, so a hung `password_command` (Vaultwarden/`bw`, network) can't block startup/reload uninterruptibly; threaded ctx from `buildSyncFn`/main.
- **Conditional-write symmetry**: `DeleteObject` now sends `If-Match: *` when no ETag is stored (matching `PutObject`); `store.SetSyncToken` gained the family's unchanged-guard + `%w` error wrap.
- **Message normalization** (owner: full): centralized the `(u to undo)` hint (in `commitMutation` + the create/quick-set/re-parent/toggle paths), added a result flash to toggle-complete (was the one silent mutation), and a `flashErr("<Action>", err)` helper so every mutation failure reads `<Action> failed: <err>` (field-validation errors stay descriptive); unified the quick vs full create flashes; capitalized the two lowercase result/error stragglers. (Skipped the internal `store:` error-prefix — it would double-prefix inside the user-facing flash.)
- **Resize Esc reverts** (owner): the `Ctrl-W` sub-mode now snapshots widths on entry so `Esc` cancels (restores) and `Enter` keeps — matching grab's semantics. Badge/help/docs updated.
- **Small consistency**: fixed a stranded doc comment (`SetCalendarReadOnly` godoc had merged into `CalendarCTag`); unified the app-level display helpers (`dueTasksByDay`, `fmtWhen`, `fmtDate`) onto `a.loc` instead of a `time.Local` literal (the remaining `time.Local` uses live in the view structs / free helpers that don't carry `a.loc`; identical today since `a.loc == time.Local`, left as an accepted follow-up); factored the UTC/all-day date-write into `newDateOrTimeProp` (shared by `setDateOrTime` and the EXDATE writer); debounced push now also armed on calendar create/rename/recolor/delete; documented the recurring-todo scope asymmetry (grab/quick-set edit the series; use `e` for per-occurrence) as an accepted, intentional difference; named `defaultSyncIntervalMinutes`; noted the subtask `guardComponent` invariant.
- Accepted as-is (defensible): over-exported-for-tests identifiers, local-FS helpers without ctx, `Item`/`Task not found` split, yank-anywhere/paste-in-Tasks.
- Tests: delete-403 transient-keeps-tombstone vs confirmed-discards; resize Esc-reverts / Enter-keeps. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/sync/sync.go`(+test), `internal/caldav/object.go`, `internal/config/config.go`, `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `internal/store/{calendar,remote}.go`, `internal/model/{edit,recur_edit}.go`, `internal/ui/{app,edit,keys,grab,quickfield,yankpaste,calendar,command,recur_edit,help}.go`(+tests), `README.md`, `main.md`.

## 2026-07-12 — Hardening pass 1: close promised-vs-implemented gaps

- A deep spec-vs-code audit (fan-out across model/sync/views/tasks/keymap/config) found the implementation very faithful — no missing keybindings or `:` commands. Closed the few real gaps and reconciled the docs; owner decided each fork.
- **Built #1 — debounced push after edits** (the one missing sync trigger): `scheduleSyncDebounced` (`internal/ui/sync.go`) arms a 3s one-shot background sync after any local mutation, hooked into `pushUndo` (the universal forward-mutation signal) and `undoLast`; no-op offline, coalesced with running/periodic sync, cancelled on quit. Shrinks the conflict window as promised.
- **Built #2 — `0` = auto-fit hour-zoom reset**: a bare `0` in the week/day grid resets the hour-row height to auto-fit (`resetHourZoom`); still extends a pending vim count otherwise.
- **Built #4 — Detail-pane resize via a `Ctrl-W` sub-mode**: a modal resize mode (badge `RESIZE`) where `←`/`→`(`h`/`l`) size the overview and `H`/`L` size the Detail pane, `Esc`/`Enter` exit — terminal-robust (no exotic modifier chords, works on a bare Pi console). Detail is now a fixed, persisted width (`state.DetailWidth`, `SaveState` gained a `detailWidth` param); `Ctrl-←`/`Ctrl-→` still quick-resize the overview.
- **Doc reconciliations** (owner decisions): #3 dropped the promised per-calendar *local color override* from the spec (colors are server-owned via `:calendar color`; hide-locally stays as a state-file toggle); #5 removed the "last-used view" state example (opening view is the config `default_view`); #6 aligned the folder-delete wording (one confirm naming the subtree count; deleting a task with any descendants removes the subtree). Fixed staleness: `help.go` DRILL badge ("calendar day", + `RESIZE`), main.md runtime-paths table now shows the `<account-id>` segment, and documented the new `Ctrl-W`/`0`/debounced-push behavior across README/main.md/CLAUDE.md.
- Two low/intentional items left as-is (documented): `RANGE=THISANDFUTURE` overrides uninterpreted, and event recurrence surfaced as a boolean "repeats" flag rather than rule text.
- Tests (`internal/ui/hardening_pass1_test.go`): `0` resets zoom (and still extends a count), debounced push arms only when configured, and the `Ctrl-W` resize sub-mode sizes overview + Detail and exits. Updated the `saveState` test closures to the new signature. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/sync.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/keys.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/help.go`, `internal/state/state.go`, `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `internal/ui/hardening_pass1_test.go` (+ test-closure fixups), `README.md`, `main.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

## 2026-07-12 — Revert #4: recurring tasks show a single live instance again

- Owner decision after a caveats review: showing every occurrence of a recurring task on the calendar (the earlier #4 change) introduced unneeded complexity, and recurring tasks-with-subtasks ("recurring folders") are a confusing fit for the tasks-as-folders model — so **recurring checklists will not be built**, and #4 is reverted to plain complete-to-advance (a recurring task shows once, at its current due, and advances one occurrence on completion). The current independent handling of a recurring task's subtasks is data-safe (verified: recurrence edits only the parent's own component, stable UID, iron-rule preservation, links never dangle); it just doesn't regenerate subtasks.
- **Reverted (the #4 parts of commit `c038393`, keeping its unrelated #5/#8):** removed `model.Todo.DuesInRange` (`internal/model/recur_todo.go` deleted); `model.DayAgenda` and `dueTasksByDay` back to the single-due path; `AdvanceRecurringTodo` back to advance-one (dropped the `completedOcc` occurrence-aware param, restored `nextInstantAfter`, COUNT decrements by one); UI callers (`advanceRecurringTodo`, `editTodoThisOccurrence`/`editTodoDetachForm`, `deleteOccurrence`, `toggleComplete`) no longer thread `occStart`.
- **Kept:** #5 (edit-this-occurrence event form re-seeds from the existing override) and #8 (grab This / This & future / All), which were bundled in the same commit but are independent; and #6 (COUNT-preserving split), a separate commit.
- Tests: removed `TestRecurringTodoShowsAllOccurrences` and `TestCompleteLaterOccurrenceAdvancesPast`; reverted the `AdvanceRecurringTodo`/`editTodoThisOccurrence` call signatures in the remaining tests. `TestRecurringTodoSpaceAdvances` (advance-one + flash) still passes.
- Docs: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` reverted to "single live instance, advances on complete"; `CLAUDE.md` records the deliberate decision not to reintroduce todo occurrence-expansion.
- Files: `internal/model/recur_edit.go`, `internal/model/agenda.go`, `internal/model/recur_edit_test.go`, `internal/model/recur_todo.go` (deleted), `internal/ui/recur_edit.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/recur_edit_test.go`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-12 — Recurrence UX round 2: all task occurrences shown, override re-seed, grab this-and-future

- Second batch of owner-requested recurrence-UX changes (caveats review, #4/#5/#8).
- **(#4) Recurring tasks show on every occurrence's due day** (was: only the current one). New `model.Todo.DuesInRange` (`internal/model/recur_todo.go`) expands a recurring todo's occurrences anchored on DUE; `model.DayAgenda` and `dueTasksByDay` now emit one entry per occurrence in the window. Completion stays advance-on-complete but is now **occurrence-aware**: `AdvanceRecurringTodo` takes the completed occurrence and skips the series *past* it (completing the 3rd of 4 jumps to the 4th; earlier ones count as passed), decrementing COUNT by the number consumed. Threaded `occStart` through `toggleComplete`/`advanceRecurringTodo`/`deleteOccurrence`/`editTodoThisOccurrence`.
- **(#5) Re-editing an occurrence pre-fills from its override** (`editEventScoped` scopeThis): seeds the form from the existing `RECURRENCE-ID` override (via `FindOverride`) when one exists — including its moved start — instead of always the master, so a prior per-occurrence edit isn't shown as reverted (and isn't silently overwritten on save).
- **(#8) Grab supports this-and-future for recurring events** (`beginGrabFuture`): the picker now offers all three scopes for grab. A future grab splits the series on start (cap master + new series via `model.SplitEvent`) and grabs the new series; cancel deletes the new series and restores the master, commit bundles both as one undo step. New grab state `grabSplitMaster`/`grabSplitMasterPrev`; removed the now-unused `nextInstantAfter`.
- Docs: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `main.md`, help overlay + grab.go comment (grab this/future/all; recurring tasks show all occurrences).
- Tests (`internal/ui/recur_edit_test.go`, `internal/model/recur_edit_test.go`): a recurring task lands on 4 weekly days; completing the 3rd occurrence advances to the 4th; re-edit seeds from the override; grab-future splits+moves and cancel restores. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/model/recur_todo.go` (new), `internal/model/recur_edit.go`, `internal/model/agenda.go`, `internal/ui/recur_edit.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/grab.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/help.go`, tests, docs.

## 2026-07-12 — Recurrence UX refinements: obvious advance flash, detach confirm, COUNT-preserving split

- Owner-requested refinements to step 11's recurring-item UX (from a caveats review).
- **(#1) Obvious advance flash** (`internal/ui/recur_edit.go` `advanceRecurringTodo`): completing a recurring todo advances it rather than checking it off, which is easy to miss. The flash is now accent-colored with a glyph and the new due date — `↻ Recurring task advanced (not completed) → next due <date>` (or `✓ Recurring task done — final occurrence completed`).
- **(#3) Detach confirmation** (`recur_edit.go` `editTodoThisOccurrence` → new `editTodoDetachForm`; `edit.go` new `confirmOK` generic-affirmative-label confirm): editing "this occurrence" of a recurring todo splits it into a separate one-off task + advances the series, which isn't obvious — now it confirms first ("… becomes a separate one-off task and the recurring series advances …", Detach/Cancel).
- **(#6) COUNT-preserving split** (`internal/model/recur_edit.go` `NewSeriesFrom` now takes `occ` + new `occurrencesBefore` helper): a this-and-future split of a COUNT-bounded series previously left the future half open-ended. The future half's COUNT is now reduced by the occurrences that stay with the capped master, so the two halves sum to the original count (UNTIL and infinite series were already exact).
- Tests: model `TestSplitSeries` now asserts the future half keeps 2 of the original 4 (was open-ended); UI `TestRecurringTodoSpaceAdvances` asserts the flash says "advanced"; new `TestEditTodoThisOccurrenceConfirms` asserts the detach confirm appears. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/model/recur_edit.go`, `internal/model/recur_edit_test.go`, `internal/ui/recur_edit.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/recur_edit_test.go`.

## 2026-07-12 — Step 13: Raspberry Pi target (cross-build, Makefile, kiosk notes)

- Build step 13. LazyPlanner is pure Go (no cgo) with the tz database embedded, so it cross-compiles to ARM from any machine with no extra toolchain — verified building statically-linked binaries for **arm64** (64-bit Pi OS), **armv7** (32-bit Pi OS), and **armv6** (Pi 1 / Zero). Stripped (`-ldflags "-s -w" -trimpath`) they're ~8.6 MB (vs 13 MB native debug).
- **Makefile** (new): `build` (native), `check` (test + vet + staticcheck — the gate), `run`, `fmt`, and `cross`/`pi-arm64`/`pi-armv7`/`pi-armv6` (stripped Pi binaries into `dist/`, gitignored), `clean`.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): added a `make cross` step so an ARM-specific build regression is caught on every push (compile-only, no emulation).
- **Docs** (`README.md`): a "Raspberry Pi / dedicated terminal" section — cross-compile (`make cross`), copy/install to the Pi, and a **kiosk** setup (console autologin on tty1 via `raspi-config`, a `~/.bash_profile` `exec lazyplanner` guarded to tty1, the equivalent getty autologin override) plus the `color_mode = "16"` tip for a bare framebuffer TTY and a note that on-hardware performance isn't benchmarked yet (the one part of step 13 that needs a physical Pi). `CLAUDE.md` build-workflow note about the Makefile.
- No app code changed; `make check` passes, all three cross-builds succeed.
- Files: `Makefile` (new), `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.gitignore` (`/dist/`), `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

## 2026-07-12 — Step 12: periodic background sync + incremental CTag short-circuit

- Build step 12 (the CTag half of incremental sync + periodic sync; the full `sync-collection` REPORT is a deliberate follow-up per the owner's scope choice).
- **Periodic background sync**: `Options.SyncIntervalMinutes` (from `config.Behavior.SyncIntervalMinutes`, default 15, 0 = off) now drives `startPeriodicSync` (`internal/ui/sync.go`) — a ticker goroutine that queues `triggerSync` onto the event-loop goroutine each interval (triggerSync touches `a.syncing`, so it must not run off it) and stops on `a.ctx.Done()` (quit). The config field was previously read but unwired.
- **Incremental CTag short-circuit**: `caldav` now fetches each collection's CalendarServer `getctag` during discovery (`internal/caldav/ctag.go`, a Depth-1 PROPFIND mirroring the color/privilege queries; best-effort — absent CTag falls back to a full sync) into `caldav.Calendar.CTag`. The store persists the last-synced CTag in the sidecar (`ctag` field) with `CalendarCTag`/`SetCalendarCTag`, plus `HasLocalChanges`. `sync.Sync` skips a calendar's full `DownloadAll` when the server CTag matches the stored one **and** there's nothing local to push, counting it in the new `SyncResult.CalendarsUnchanged`; the CTag is cached only after a fully clean reconcile (a per-resource failure re-syncs next time).
- Docs: `README.md` (syncing section + `r`/status + status line), `CLAUDE.md`, config comment de-staled.
- Tests: `internal/sync/sync_test.go` — an unchanged CTag skips the second sync's download, a changed CTag forces a re-download, and a pending local change still pushes despite an unchanged CTag (fake gained a `downloads` counter). Full gate passes. (Network paths are exercised against the fake Syncer, as the existing sync tests are; the live NextCloud path is unverified in this environment.)
- Files: `internal/caldav/ctag.go` (new), `internal/caldav/client.go`, `internal/store/store.go`, `internal/store/sidecar.go`, `internal/store/calendar.go`, `internal/sync/sync.go`, `internal/ui/sync.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `internal/config/config.go`, `internal/sync/sync_test.go`, docs.

## 2026-07-12 — Step 11 (UI): recurrence editing — this / this-and-future / all

- Build step 11, part 2 of 2 (UI). Wired the recurrence-editing scopes into edit (`e`), delete (`d`), grab (`m`), and complete (`Space`), for events and todos.
- **Scope picker** (`internal/ui/recur_edit.go` `pickRecurrenceScope`): a modal offering *This / This & future / All* (events) or *This / All* (todos — a todo shows one live instance, so future collapses into all). Opened by `editRecurring`/`deleteRecurring` when `currentTarget` reports a recurring item.
- **editTarget** gained `occStart`/`allDay`/`recurring`, populated by `targetFromItem` (the occurrence's instant = the RECURRENCE-ID target) and the tree branch of `currentTarget`.
- **Events**: this → `EditEventOccurrence` (override) / `AddException` (delete); future → `SplitEvent` (cap master + new series, one two-op undo step via `commitSplit`) / `CapSeries` (delete); all → the existing master edit / whole-object delete. The event form is reused via the extracted `presentEventForm`, seeded at the occurrence's start.
- **Todos**: `Space` on a recurring todo advances it (`advanceRecurringTodo` → `AdvanceRecurringTodo`) instead of completing; edit-this-occurrence detaches the instance as a standalone task (`presentTodoForm` + `NewTodoObject`) and advances the master; delete-this skips the occurrence (advancing), deleting the resource outright when it was the last.
- **Grab** on a recurring event prompts *This / All* (not future — a split spawns a second resource that grab's single-snapshot revert can't undo; the edit form covers this-and-future). `beginGrab` records the scope; `grabNudge` reads/moves the RECURRENCE-ID override for a this-scope grab (synthesizing the occurrence's slot before the first override exists) and `focusGrabbed` anchors on the moved override. New model helper `Parsed.FindOverride`.
- `recurScope`'s zero value is `scopeAll` deliberately, so any unset path (non-recurring items, tests that set grab state directly) behaves as the pre-step-11 whole-series edit.
- Docs: help overlay (recurrence rows), `README.md`, `main.md`, `CLAUDE.md`. gofmt'd the grab-field block in `app.go` (my field additions shifted its alignment).
- Tests (`internal/ui/recur_edit_test.go`): Space advances a recurring todo; delete-occurrence EXDATEs an event instance; a this-occurrence grab creates an override moving only that instance; `e` on a recurring item opens the scope picker. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/recur_edit.go` (new), `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/grab.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/help.go`, `internal/model/recur_edit.go` (+`EditEventOccurrence`/`SplitEvent`/`FindOverride`), `internal/ui/recur_edit_test.go`, docs.

## 2026-07-12 — Step 11 (model): recurrence-editing primitives

- Build step 11, part 1 of 2 (model layer). Added the write-side recurrence primitives for the three edit scopes, for VEVENTs and VTODOs (`internal/model/recur_edit.go`). Read-side expansion + RECURRENCE-ID overrides already existed (step 3); this is the editing half.
- **Events** (all occurrences displayed): `AddOccurrenceOverride` (this-occurrence → a RECURRENCE-ID override component sharing the master's UID, in the same object), `AddException` (delete this-occurrence → EXDATE + drop any override at that slot), `CapSeries` (this-and-future → cap the master's RRULE with UNTIL, drop COUNT and later overrides; also the whole of a future-delete), `NewSeriesFrom` (the future half of a split → a fresh-UID object cloned from the master, keeping an absolute UNTIL but dropping COUNT). "All" is the existing `EditEvent` on the master.
- **Todos** (shown once, complete = advance, NextCloud-style): `AdvanceRecurringTodo` rolls DTSTART/DUE to the next occurrence (preserving their offset), decrements COUNT, and marks the todo completed when the series is exhausted. The UI orchestrates "edit this occurrence" as a detached standalone task + advance (no override-on-read needed for todos).
- Helpers: `masterComponent`, `componentAnchor` (DTSTART, else DUE), `componentRecurrenceSet`/`nextInstantAfter` (write-side twins of the read-side set), `cloneOverrideComponent` (deep prop/param copy, drops series-level RRULE/RDATE/EXDATE). Known simplification (documented in code): splitting a COUNT-bounded series leaves the tail open-ended; UNTIL-bounded and infinite series split exactly.
- Tests (`internal/model/recur_edit_test.go`): override replaces one slot and preserves the rest; exception suppresses one; cap ends the series; split caps the master + spawns a fresh-UID future series; advance rolls a weekly todo forward and completes the last occurrence. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/model/recur_edit.go`, `internal/model/recur_edit_test.go`.

## 2026-07-12 — Cross-view consistency F6: paste target via currentTarget

- Drift-prevention refactor (no behavior change). `pasteUnderSelection` read `a.tree.GetCurrentNode()` directly to find the paste parent, while every other action resolves the selection via `currentTarget()`. It now uses `currentTarget()` (identical in Tasks mode, where the tree node is what currentTarget returns) so paste can't silently read a stale tree selection if it's ever ungated from Tasks-only. `paste()` still gates to Tasks mode.
- (F5 was effectively resolved by M3: `editSelected` and `deleteContextual` now both lead with `GetFocus()` for the overview panes. The one remaining divergence — `e` edits the highlighted calendar from a focused-but-undrilled grid, with no `d` equivalent — is an intentional convenience, documented in `editSelected`.)
- Existing yank/paste tests cover the unchanged tree behavior. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/yankpaste.go`.

## 2026-07-12 — Cross-view consistency F4: unify the drilled-item read via calGrid

- Drift-prevention refactor (no behavior change). `currentTarget` read the month drill inline (`a.month.selectedItems()` + `eventIndex`) but the week/day drill via `a.timegrid.selectedItem()` — two hand-synced shapes for "the drilled item," despite the `calGrid` interface already unifying `drillState`/`reDrill`. Added `selectedItem() *model.AgendaItem` to `calGrid`, implemented it on `calendarView` (mirroring the existing `timeGridView` method), and collapsed `currentTarget`'s calendar branch to `a.calendarPrimitive().(calGrid).selectedItem()`.
- Existing drilled-target tests (month + week grid Space) cover the unified path. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/calendarview.go`, `internal/ui/app.go` (interface), `internal/ui/edit.go` (`currentTarget`).

## 2026-07-12 — Cross-view consistency F1+F2: single source for folder + checkbox

- Drift-prevention refactors (no behavior change). (F1) `hasIncompleteChildren` (the "can't complete a folder" guard) reimplemented the same "has an incomplete child" predicate as `folderSet` (which drives the ▸ folder caret) — independent copies that could silently desync the caret from the guard. `hasIncompleteChildren` now delegates to `folderSet(a.store.Todos())` so both share one definition (computed fresh; it's a completion-time call, not a draw). (F2) `nodeLabel` reimplemented the `[ ]`/`[■]` checkbox literals inline; it now delegates the non-folder case to the shared `todoMark`, so the checkbox glyph has one source across tree/month/time-grid/agenda (the tree keeps its expand-aware ▾/▸ folder caret). Fixed the stale `[ ] / [x]` doc comment.
- Existing tests (folder-completion guard, glyph renders) cover the unchanged behavior. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/render.go`.

## 2026-07-12 — Cross-view consistency L1: agenda selection box follows focus

- The agenda selection box was hardwired to the focused border color, while the calendar selected-day box uses the idle color until its grid is focused. Gave `agendaBoard` an `active func() bool` closure (wired to `a.agendaList.HasFocus` — a plain field read, safe in a draw path unlike `Application.GetFocus`); `drawSelBox` now uses the focused color only when active, matching the calendar day box.
- Files: `internal/ui/agendaboard.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/lowfixes_test.go`. Committed together as the Low-tier polish batch.

## 2026-07-12 — Cross-view consistency L2: document the drilled-block highlight exception

- Doc-only: the drilled item is reverse-video in month cells / the all-day band / task-marker rows, but a filled accent chip on time-grid event blocks. Added a comment explaining the exception is deliberate (reverse-video is illegible over an already-filled color block), so it doesn't read as accidental drift. No behavior change.
- Files: `internal/ui/timegridview.go`. Low-tier batch.

## 2026-07-12 — Cross-view consistency L3: drilled all-day due task keeps its marker

- A selected (drilled) all-day due task in the time-grid's top band had its label overwritten with a bare title, dropping the `[ ]`/`[■]`/`▸` marker it shows when un-selected. Now the band keeps `taskMarkerLabel` for a selected todo (bare title only for a selected all-day event, which has no marker).
- Files: `internal/ui/timegridview.go`, `internal/ui/lowfixes_test.go`. Low-tier batch.

## 2026-07-12 — Cross-view consistency L4: grab time-hint no longer names a dead key

- Grabbing an event in the agenda and pressing `j`/`k`/`J`/`K` flashed "switch to week/day view (v)…", but `v` is a no-op in agenda mode. New `grabTimeHint` helper names `(v)` only in calendar mode and points to "the week/day calendar view" in agenda mode (no dead key). `grabStatus` already omitted `v` for this case; the transient nudge hint now agrees.
- Files: `internal/ui/grab.go`, `internal/ui/lowfixes_test.go`. Low-tier batch.

## 2026-07-12 — Cross-view consistency L5: Space on a drilled event flashes instead of hiding

- With no task drilled, `Space` in a calendar view toggles the highlighted calendar's visibility (by design). But when drilled into an *event*, `Space` also flipped visibility — a surprise. The Space handler now three-ways: drilled todo → complete, drilled event → flash "Can't complete an event", nothing drilled → toggle visibility.
- Docs: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (Space description).
- Files: `internal/ui/app.go`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `internal/ui/lowfixes_test.go`. Low-tier batch.

## 2026-07-12 — Cross-view consistency M3: `e` edits the task list from the Tasks pane

- Audit fix 6 of N. The Calendars and Tasks overview panes were asymmetric for edit vs delete: `d` (`deleteContextual`) branches on `GetFocus()` and deletes the focused pane's collection (calendar or list), but `e` (`editSelected`) never opened a list's edit form — in `modeTasks`, `currentTarget()` returns the current tree node regardless of which pane holds focus, so `e` always edited the highlighted *task*. There was no keyboard path to a task list's name/color form (only `:calendar rename`/`color`).
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/edit.go` `editSelected`): check `GetFocus()` first (mirroring `deleteContextual`) — the Calendars pane opens the calendar edit form, the Tasks pane the highlighted list's (both are calendars → same `showCalendarForm`). The existing `mode == modeCalendar` fallback stays, preserving the convenience of `e` editing the highlighted calendar from the focused-but-undrilled grid.
- Docs: `README.md`, `main.md` (`e` row + calendar-form prose now note the Tasks pane edits the list, symmetric with `d`).
- Tests (`internal/ui/editlist_test.go`, new): `e` with the Tasks pane focused opens the list form (first field "Name"); `e` with the tree focused still opens the task form (first field "Summary"). Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/edit.go`, `README.md`, `main.md`, `internal/ui/editlist_test.go`.

## 2026-07-12 — Cross-view consistency M2: `<count>G` honored in the tree and drilled grid

- Audit fix 5 of N. `<count>G` (vim "go to nth item") was handled only for `*tview.List`, so it worked in the overview/agenda lists but was silently discarded in the task tree (`5G` → last node) and calendar grid (→ last day/item).
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/keys.go` `gotoBottom`): the tree branch now selects the count-th visible node (`clampIndex(count-1, len(nodes))`) instead of always the last; added a branch so a **drilled** calendar day (a list of that day's events) honors the count via `reDrill(day, count-1)`. An undrilled grid is 2D, so a count there still lands on the last day (documented). The `*tview.List` branch was tidied to share the clamp.
- Docs: `README.md`, `main.md` `gg`/`G` rows (nth item of a list, the tree, or a drilled day).
- Tests (`internal/ui/countg_test.go`, new): `<count>G` selects the nth visible tree node, `G` the last, and an over-large count clamps. Existing `TestGotoTopAndBottom` (list) still passes. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/keys.go`, `README.md`, `main.md`, `internal/ui/countg_test.go`.

## 2026-07-12 — Cross-view consistency M1: mode indicator — tree focus is NORMAL, not DRILL

- Audit fix 4 of N. The mode badge showed `DRILL` the instant the task tree was focused (one Enter from the overview), but the parallel calendar state — grid focused, undrilled — showed `NORMAL` (a day-drill needs a second Enter). So "just dived into Main, hjkl moves things" read differently for the tree vs the grid. Owner chose to align by making tree focus read NORMAL: `DRILL` now means uniformly "drilled into a sub-element" — the calendar-day drill — and merely focusing the tree or grid is ordinary Main navigation (NORMAL). The tree has no deeper level, so DRILL never shows in Tasks.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/render.go`): dropped the `a.mode == modeTasks && a.focused == a.tree` case from `interactionMode` (now just `grabbing` → GRAB, `gridDrilled()` → DRILL, else NORMAL).
- Removed the now-dead `a.focused` field + its `setFocus` assignment (`internal/ui/app.go`): it existed only so the draw-time mode indicator could avoid a `GetFocus()` deadlock; `interactionMode` no longer reads focus at all (only `a.grabbing` + `a.gridDrilled()`, neither takes the app lock), so the draw path stays deadlock-safe and the field is unused. Updated the `CLAUDE.md` freeze-trap note that referenced `a.focused`.
- Docs: `README.md`, `main.md`, `CLAUDE.md` mode-indicator descriptions (DRILL = calendar-day drill only).
- Tests (`internal/ui/mode_test.go`): `TestInteractionMode` now asserts drilled calendar day = DRILL and focused tree = NORMAL (was DRILL). The `modedeadlock_test.go` regression still passes (no GetFocus in the draw path). Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/mode_test.go`, `README.md`, `main.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

## 2026-07-12 — Cross-view consistency H3: quick-set (sp/sd) works in any view

- Audit fix 3 of N. The `s` quick-set chord (`sp` priority, `sd` due) was hard-gated to the Tasks view (`app.go` `case 's'` flashed "set: Tasks view only" everywhere else), even though a task drilled into in the calendar or selected in the agenda can already be completed (`Space`), edited (`e`), deleted (`d`), and grab-nudged (`m`) — all via `currentTarget()`, the same resolver `setPriorityPrompt`/`setDuePrompt` use through `quickTaskTarget()`. Only the one-line dispatch gate made it tree-only; the handlers were already view-agnostic. Especially odd: `sd` (set due) was blocked while `m` (grab, which also changes due) was allowed.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/app.go`): `case 's'` now unconditionally enters the set prefix. `quickTaskTarget` already flashes "Select a task first" when no task is selected, so no mode gate is needed. `z`/fold stays Tasks-only (folds are genuinely tree-specific) — deliberately not changed.
- Docs (`README.md`): noted `sp`/`sd` act on the selected task in any view, parallel to the existing `Space` note.
- Tests (`internal/ui/quickset_crossview_test.go`, new): pressing `s` in calendar mode now enters the set prefix (was refused), and `quickTaskTarget` resolves a task drilled into in the month grid. Full gate passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/app.go`, `README.md`, `internal/ui/quickset_crossview_test.go`.

## 2026-07-12 — Cross-view consistency H2: `.` hide-completed now applies to calendar + agenda

- Audit fix 2 of N (with its coupled F-sticky). The `.` show/hide-completed toggle was honored only in the task tree; the month grid, week/day time-grid, and agenda always showed completed due tasks (`[■]`) regardless. `showCompleted` was consulted only in the tree build — the calendar/agenda data builders never filtered it (a comment in `dueTasksByDay` even documented the divergence as intentional).
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/render.go`): added `completedVisible(t)` (the single rule — shown unless completed-hidden and not stickyDone-pinned) and `visibleTodos(todos)`; applied across the tree build, `calItems` (month), `dayItems` (agenda + agenda-left), and `dueTasksByDay` (time-grid). The tree's inline filter now calls the shared helper (removes a duplicated condition). Updated the stale `dueTasksByDay` comment.
- **F-sticky** (`internal/ui/edit.go`): dropped the `a.mode == modeTasks` gate in `toggleComplete` so a just-completed task is pinned visible (`stickyDone`) in any view — otherwise checking one off in the calendar/agenda while completed are hidden would make it vanish instantly, violating "keeps it visible until you leave the view." stickyDone still clears on switching list or pane (`setMode`), which is the calendar/agenda analog of "leaving the list."
- `reloadCurrent` (`internal/ui/app.go`): the agenda case now rebuilds the left list too, so `.` updates both halves of the agenda together.
- No doc change: `main.md`/`README.md` already state completed tasks are "hidden by default; `.` toggles" in week/day — the code now matches the spec.
- Tests (`internal/ui/hidecompleted_test.go`, new): a completed due task is present in the agenda + time-grid builders when completed are shown, absent when hidden, and kept when sticky-pinned; and completing a task via Space in the agenda while hidden pins it (F-sticky). Full gate (build/vet/staticcheck/`go test ./...`) passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/render.go`, `internal/ui/edit.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/hidecompleted_test.go`.

## 2026-07-12 — Cross-view consistency H1: agenda board shows task glyphs

- Cross-view consistency audit, fix 1 of N. The full-detail Agenda center board (`agendaBoard`) was the one task renderer that drew neither the `[ ]`/`[■]` checkbox nor the `▸` folder caret — a task showed as `<when>  <summary>` with completion conveyed only by a status word, while the tree, month grid, week/day grid, and even the Agenda *left* list all route through the shared `todoMark`. The board struct was never given an `isFolder` closure (only `itemColor` was wired), so it structurally couldn't draw a caret.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/agendaboard.go`): added an `isFolder func(uid string) bool` field + a `folderItem` helper on `agendaBoard`; `agendaItemLines` now takes a `folder bool` and prepends `todoMark(t, folder)` to the task title line (placed after the time label so the time column stays aligned between tasks and events). Events are unchanged (no marker). Wired `a.agenda.isFolder = a.isFolder` in `app.go` next to the existing `month`/`timegrid` wiring.
- No doc change: `README.md`/`main.md` already state the caret/checkbox appear in the agenda — this was the code failing to match the spec, not a behavior change to document.
- Tests (`internal/ui/agendaboard_test.go`, new): `agendaItemLines` renders `[ ]` incomplete / `[■]` completed / `▸` folder for tasks, and no marker for events. Full gate (build/vet/staticcheck/`go test ./...`) passes.
- Files: `internal/ui/agendaboard.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/agendaboard_test.go`.

## 2026-07-10 — Wrap-up: docs + freeze guardrails for the next agent

- End-of-session housekeeping. Added a CLAUDE.md Architecture Rules block documenting the two tview freeze traps fixed today (no app-lock calls from a draw func; keep the task tree on `SetGraphics(false)`) plus the "never hand-edit `vendor/`" rule, so they aren't reintroduced.
- Fixed a stale comment in `buildTreeForList` (it referred to tree "connector stems", which no longer render with branch-graphics off).
- Refreshed project memory: added `project-status.md` (steps 1–10 + this session's grab/yank/mode-indicator polish complete; next = step 11 recurrence editing, which also unblocks grab's deferred recurring-event/undated-task cases).
- Files: `CLAUDE.md`, `internal/ui/render.go` (comment), memory files.

## 2026-07-10 — Fix freeze on entering Tasks view (mode-indicator draw deadlock)

- Reported: the app hangs the instant `t` is pressed. Root cause is the **status-bar mode indicator**: its `SetDrawFunc` (`drawModeIndicator` → `interactionMode`) called `a.tv.GetFocus()`, which takes the tview app **read-lock**. But `Application.draw()` holds the **write-lock** for the whole draw, and Go's `sync.RWMutex` isn't reentrant — so reading focus during a draw self-deadlocks. It only triggered in Tasks mode because the `GetFocus()` call sat behind a short-circuited `a.mode == modeTasks && …` (calendar/agenda never evaluated it), and only in the live event loop (a one-shot `primitive.Draw()` in tests doesn't take the app lock — which is why the earlier draw tests missed it). Independent of tree depth/data.
- **Fix**: track the focused pane in `a.focused`, set in `setFocus` (the single focus path — mouse and modal-restore both route through it), and have `interactionMode` read `a.focused` instead of calling `GetFocus()` during the draw. No lock taken from a draw func.
- Test: `internal/ui/modedeadlock_test.go` runs the real event loop in Tasks mode against a simulation screen and waits for `SetAfterDrawFunc` to fire; a deadlocked draw never fires it, so a 5s watchdog trips. Verified it fails (times out) with the old `GetFocus()` call and passes with the fix. Full gate + `-race` pass.
- Files: `internal/ui/app.go` (field + `setFocus`), `internal/ui/render.go` (`interactionMode`), `internal/ui/modedeadlock_test.go`.

## 2026-07-10 — Fix app-freeze: disable tview tree branch-graphics

- Diagnosed a reported "crash" — actually a **100% CPU hang**, not a panic. Root cause is upstream `github.com/rivo/tview` v0.42.0 `TreeView.Draw`: the ancestor-branch-drawing loop does `if ancestor.graphicsX >= width { continue }` without advancing `ancestor`, so it spins forever whenever a node's ancestor indent reaches the tree pane's width. Triggered by a deep-enough subtask tree in a tree pane narrower than the deepest indent (~12–15 levels at 80 cols; far shallower in a narrow terminal or after widening the overview). Our recent yank/paste makes deep trees easy to build, which is why it surfaced now — but the faulty line is pre-existing library code (still present on tview master), and grab/yank/mode-indicator code is all correctly guarded (confirmed by a fuzzing sweep of the since-audit diff).
- **Fix**: `a.tree.SetGraphics(false)` in our own code — the entire buggy loop is gated behind `if t.graphics`, so this sidesteps it with **no edits to vendored/third-party source**. An earlier commit patched the vendored file directly; that was reverted (the vendored tview is now byte-identical to upstream v0.42.0) in favour of this in-code fix, since editing a vendored dep is silently lost on the next `go mod vendor`. Cost: the tree loses tview's `├─ │ └─` connector lines; nesting is still shown by indentation and our own `▸`/`▾` folder carets.
- Test: `internal/ui/treedraw_regress_test.go` builds a 20-deep subtask chain and draws the app's tree in an 8-col pane under a 5s watchdog — passes now, and (verified) hangs/times out if `SetGraphics(false)` is dropped.
- Files: `internal/ui/app.go`, `internal/ui/treedraw_regress_test.go`; reverted `vendor/github.com/rivo/tview/treeview.go` to pristine.

## 2026-07-10 — Status-bar mode indicator + outlined status bar

- Surfaced the **interaction mode** as a vim-style badge, prompted by grab mode making "modes" concrete. Distinguishes the *interaction* mode (what the movement keys act on now) from the *view* context (Calendar/Tasks/Agenda, already shown as text).
- **Impl** (`render.go`, `app.go`): new `interactionMode()` derives the mode from existing state — `GRAB` (`a.grabbing`), `DRILL` (calendar day drilled via `gridDrilled`, or dived into the task tree), else `NORMAL` — with no new state machine, so it doubles as the seam for a future dispatch cleanup. The badge is a custom-drawn `*tview.Box` (`drawModeIndicator`, `SetDrawFunc`) rather than a TextView, so it stays live every frame regardless of which transition path fired (drill/undrill and grab enter/exit don't all funnel through `updateStatus`). Filled high-contrast chip for the active modes (DRILL = teal, GRAB = yellow), dim label at rest.
- Status bar now has **four sections** (mode · general/results · command view · sync) and is **outlined** with a rounded border like the primary panes (3 rows instead of 1); renamed the very-bottom controls line to the "help bar" in the docs.
- Docs: help overlay row, `main.md` status-bar section, `CLAUDE.md` UI line, `README.md`.
- Tests (`mode_test.go`): `interactionMode` transitions (NORMAL/GRAB/DRILL) and a render test asserting the `NORMAL`/`GRAB` badge and the border paint to a simulation screen. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-10 — Grab mode (`m`): move/resize events, nudge task due dates

- Update 2 of 2: the temporal-manipulation layer, unified across tree/calendar/agenda (the "grab mode" designed earlier). Complements yank/paste (structural) — grab only touches *when*.
- **Impl** (`internal/ui/grab.go`, `app.go`): `m` grabs the current target (via `currentTarget`); modal — `globalKeys` routes every key to `handleGrabKey` while `a.grabbing`. **Event** (week/day view): `j`/`k` ±hour, `h`/`l` ±day, `J`/`K` resize the end (min-duration guard); month/all-day = day-move only. **Task**: `j`/`k` due ±day, `h`/`l` ±week. Edits commit to the store on each nudge (via `EditEvent`/`EditTodo` + `draftFromEvent`/`draftFromTodo`, preserving all other props) so views update live; `focusGrabbed` re-anchors the calendar to the item's (possibly new) day and re-drills onto its block, or re-selects the task by UID. `Enter` keeps (pre-grab snapshot = one undo step); `Esc` `Restore`s the snapshot. Undated tasks and recurring events are skipped with a hint (recurrence editing is step 11).
- Docs: help overlay, `main.md` keymap, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`.
- Tests (`grab_test.go`): task due nudge (+2 days, commit), undated-task skip, event day-move + resize + Esc-reverts, and `m`/`j`/Enter wiring through `globalKeys`. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Yank/paste update: cut vs copy, top-level paste, persistent clipboard (tasks)

- Owner request (Update 1 of 2; grab mode is Update 2). Reworked task yank/paste around a small target-agnostic clipboard: cut vs copy, paste at the top level, and a clipboard that survives paste (multi-paste). Scoped to **tasks** (events get the planned grab mode).
- **Keys** (`internal/ui/app.go`): `y` = cut (move on paste), `Y` = copy (duplicate), `p` = paste under the selected task, `P` = paste at the list top level. `Y`/`P` were free.
- **UI** (`internal/ui/yankpaste.go`): `setClip(cut)` records the clipboard (`yankUID` + `yankCut`) from `currentTarget()`; `paste(targetParent)` dispatches to move (existing `reparentTo`/`moveSubtree`) or the new `copySubtree`. The clipboard is **no longer cleared** on paste (was `a.yankUID = ""`), so the same task can be pasted repeatedly. Cycle guards (onto-self / into-own-subtree) apply only to cut; a copy is an independent tree. `copySubtree` duplicates root+descendants with fresh UIDs, remapping each child's parent link to its copy, all-or-nothing with rollback; undo deletes the copies.
- **Model** (`internal/model/edit.go`): new `CopyTodo(obj, uid, newUID, newParentUID, …)` — re-keys UID + re-parents while preserving every other iCal property (iron rule), via the same clone-through-encode path as `EditTodo`.
- Docs: help overlay, `main.md` keymap, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`. Memory: recorded the grab-mode design for Update 2 ([[grab-mode-plan]]).
- Tests: `copypaste_test.go` (`Y` copy duplicates with a fresh UID + persists for multi-paste; `P` pastes at top level; subtree copy remaps children to the copied parent); `edit_test.go` `TestCopyTodo` (fresh UID + new parent, preserves summary/categories/X-props/VALARM); migrated the two existing move tests to the persistent-clipboard assertion and the renamed `pasteUnderSelection`. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Hidden calendars drop their color bullet

- Owner request: hiding a calendar should remove the `●` color bullet in the Calendars list, so a hidden calendar reads more clearly at a glance (alongside the existing `(hidden)` marker).
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/render.go` `buildCalendars`): only prepend the color bullet when the calendar isn't hidden (`ok && !a.hidden[cal.ID]`). Name/count/markers unchanged.
- Docs: `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` (bullet/color-dot descriptions note it drops when hidden).
- Tests (`colorrender_test.go`): `TestHiddenCalendarDropsColorBullet` — a colored calendar shows the bullet when visible and drops it (with `(hidden)` shown) when hidden. Full gate pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Audit items 15 & 16: mouse — wheel-paging dropped, click-to-fold confirmed

- **15 — wheel paging the calendar grid**: owner chose to drop it from the spec rather than implement. Updated `main.md`'s Mouse section (keyboard `f`/`b` pages the grids; the custom widgets take no wheel handler).
- **16 — click a folder to expand/collapse**: audit finding was a **false positive** — this already works. `a.tree.SetSelectedFunc` (`app.go`) toggles a node's expansion and updates its `▸`/`▾` caret, and tview's TreeView fires that callback on a left-click (not just Enter). The agent missed it because the wiring is in `app.go`, not `mouse.go`. Verified by simulation (click flips a folder expanded→collapsed) and locked in with a regression test.
- Tests (`treeclick_test.go`): `TestTreeClickTogglesFolder` drives a left-click on a folder row and asserts its expansion toggles. Full gate + `-race` pass.
- **Audit follow-up plan complete** — all 16 items resolved (13 changes committed; item 9 deferred to step 12; item 16 was already implemented).

## 2026-07-10 — Audit item 14: `:calendar new` command

- Gap: main.md's command list included `:calendar new` but `cmdCalendar` only handled rename/color/hide/show (creation was only on the `ic`/`il` chords).
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/command.go`): `:calendar new` opens the create/edit calendar form (`showCalendarForm("", 0)`), handled before the "select a calendar first" guard since it needs no highlight. Fallback hint + help overlay updated to list `new`.
- Tests (`calendarcmd_test.go`): `TestCalendarNewOpensForm` — `:calendar new` opens the form page. Full gate pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Audit item 13: clearing an event's end removes DTEND

- Owner decision: make the event edit contract symmetric with the todo one — `applyEvent` only wrote DTEND when End was set, so a zero End left the old DTEND in place (couldn't make an event zero-duration). Benign today (the UI form always supplies End), but the asymmetry with `applyTodo`'s DUE handling was real.
- **Fix** (`internal/model/edit.go`): `applyEvent` now always drops DURATION, writes DTEND when End is set, and `Del`s DTEND when End is zero (mirroring how a missing DUE is deleted).
- Tests (`edit_test.go`): `TestEditEventClearsDTEND` — editing an event with a zero End removes DTEND while DTSTART remains. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Audit item 12: re-fetch the server version on a 412 conflict

- Owner decision: on a 412 (server changed since our download), the conflict was stashed with the `serverObj` fetched at the *start* of the sync — stale by definition of a 412, so the conflict view could show an out-of-date server side and keep-server needed an extra round.
- **Fix** (`internal/caldav/client.go`, `sync/sync.go`): new `Client.GetObject(ctx, href)` (wraps go-webdav's `GetCalendarObject`) fetches a single resource fresh; `Syncer` gained `GetObject`; `pushUpdate`'s 412 branch now re-fetches the current server version and stashes that (falls back to the start-of-sync `serverObj` if the re-fetch fails). Conflict now reflects the true server state and resolves in one round.
- Tests (`sync_test.go`): fake gained `GetObject` (+ a `getData` override so the re-fetched version can differ, and a `gets` spy); `TestSyncRefetchesOn412` asserts the stashed conflict carries the fresh `srv-2` ETag, not the stale `srv-1`. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Audit item 11: split the calendar pending-props flag (name vs color)

- Owner decision: the single `pendingProps` flag meant a pending local **name** edit blocked adopting the server's **color** (and vice-versa, now that name is pulled too). Split it.
- **Fix** (`internal/store`): `calState`/sidecar gained `pendingName` + `pendingColor` (`pending_name`/`pending_color`), replacing `pendingProps`; the legacy `pending_props` is still read and mapped onto both for backward compatibility. `UpdateCalendarMeta` sets each flag only for the field it changed; `SyncCalendarColor`/`SyncCalendarName` skip only on their own flag; `PendingCalendarProps` emits **only the pending field(s)** so a PROPPATCH can't clobber a concurrent server edit to the other; `MarkCalendarPropsSynced` clears both.
- Tests (`pendingflags_test.go`): a pending name doesn't block the color pull (and the pull-name is still blocked + only the name is pushed); a legacy `pending_props` sidecar loads as both pending. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Audit item 10: pull server-side calendar renames

- Owner decision: names are "server-authoritative" but only color/read-only/components were pulled each sync — a rename on NextCloud web or another client never showed up locally. Also confirmed in-app renaming already exists (`:calendar rename` and the `e` edit-form Name field). (Item 9 — debounced push — deferred to build step 12.)
- **Fix** (`internal/store/calendar.go`, `sync/sync.go`): new `SyncCalendarName` mirrors `SyncCalendarColor` — adopt the server's display name, server-authoritative except when a local rename is still pending a PROPPATCH (no-op on empty/unchanged). Called per calendar in the sync discovery loop alongside the color pull.
- Docs: `main.md` calendar-metadata decision + `CLAUDE.md` (names *and* colors sync both ways).
- Tests (`sync_test.go`): `TestSyncPullsCalendarRename` (server rename adopted) and `TestSyncDoesNotClobberPendingLocalRename` (pending local rename wins and is pushed). Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Audit item 8: cancellable sync context (clean shutdown)

- Owner decision: honor the "all network I/O is cancellable" architecture rule at the one spot that didn't — the sync caller. (Data was already safe either way via atomic writes + ETag reconciliation; this is about a clean unwind vs a detach/hard-kill on quit.)
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/app.go`, `sync.go`): the app now holds `ctx`/`cancel` (`context.WithCancel`, created in `newApp`); `Run` defers `a.cancel()` so quitting cancels it. `triggerSync` passes `a.ctx` instead of `context.Background()`, so an in-flight background sync unwinds at its next `ctx.Err()` checkpoint (the sync/caldav stack already threads ctx everywhere).
- Tests (`sync_test.go`): `TestSyncUsesCancellableContext` — the sync receives a live context and `a.cancel()` cancels it. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Audit item 7: surface :config reload errors + validate appearance enums

- **7a — reload connection errors reach the UI** (`cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `ui.ConfigReload`, `command.go`): `buildSyncFn` now returns `(closure, warning)` instead of printing to stderr; on a `:config` reload the warning (e.g. "password_command failed (offline)") is carried in `ConfigReload.Warning` and flashed in the status bar, so a reload that dropped to offline isn't lost behind the suspended TUI. Startup still prints the warning to stderr.
- **7b — unknown [appearance] values warn** (`internal/config/config.go`): `appearanceWarnings` checks `first_day_of_week`/`default_view`/`time_format`/`date_format`/`color_mode` against their allowed sets and appends a non-fatal warning naming any typo (value still falls back to the default), joined with the permission warning.
- Tests: `config` — `TestLoadWarnsOnUnknownAppearance` (bad default_view/time_format named); `ui` — `TestApplyConfigReloadFlashesWarning`. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Audit item 6: wire the [appearance] config options

- The four `[appearance]` options were parsed but never consumed (the UI hardcoded them). Wired all four end-to-end.
- **Plumbing** (`cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `ui.Options`, `app`): pass `FirstDayOfWeek`/`DefaultView`/`TimeFormat`/`DateFormat`; `Run` resolves them into `a.weekStartMonday`, `a.viewMode`, `a.clock24`, `a.dateISO`, and mirrors `clock24` onto the three custom widgets.
- **Format helpers** (`internal/ui/format.go`): `clockStr` (12h/24h), `hourAxisLabel` (axis/cell hour), `dateStr`/`dateShortStr` (US `01/02/2006` vs ISO `2006-01-02`), plus `parseWeekStartMonday`/`parseDefaultView`. Replaced the literal `Format("3pm")`/`"3:04pm"`/`"15:04"`/date calls across `render.go`, `calendarview.go`, `timegridview.go`, `agendaboard.go`, `sync.go` (agenda times, hour axis, event-block span, month-cell times, due dates, detail When/Due, status-bar date, last-sync time). Editable form date/time fields keep their fixed ISO/24h layout (they round-trip through the parser).
- **Effects**: `first_day_of_week=sunday` → Sunday-start grid; `default_view=week|day` → opening view; `time_format=24h` → 14:30 clock everywhere; `date_format=iso` → 2026-07-04 dates. Note: `date_format` now renders **numeric** dates (default US `07/04/2026`) in the data displays (due dates, detail, status) — previously month-name `Jan 2`; the calendar/agenda prose headers stay month-name.
- Tests (`format_test.go`): `clockStr`/`hourAxisLabel`/`dateStr` tables, `parseWeekStartMonday`/`parseDefaultView`, and a detail-pane render asserting 24h+ISO take effect. Updated the sync-status test to set `clock24`. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Audit item 5: task-subtree zoom (`>`/`<`) implemented

- Closed the highest-value gap: `>`/`<` subtree zoom was documented (main.md/CLAUDE.md) but entirely unimplemented. Built it to spec (full re-root + breadcrumb).
- **Impl** (`internal/ui/render.go`, `app.go`): new `a.zoomUID` (task the tree is re-rooted at; "" = list root). `buildTreeForList` now, when zoomed, finds the node (`findTodoNode`), shows its children as the tree roots, and sets the root label to a `List / ancestor / task` breadcrumb (`zoomBreadcrumb`). `zoomInTree` (`>`) re-roots at the selected task; `zoomOutTree` (`<`) pops one level (to the task's parent, or the list root). A stale zoom (task deleted) resets; switching lists clears it. `>`/`<` wired in `globalKeys` (Tasks mode only) — they were inert before.
- Docs: help overlay (`> / <` row), `README.md` Tasks section. (main.md/CLAUDE.md already described it.)
- Tests (`zoom_test.go`): `TestTreeSubtreeZoom` — zoom-in re-roots with a breadcrumb and shows the subtask as the child, zoom-out returns to the list root, and a list switch clears the zoom. Verified the render visually (`Personal / ECE384` root over its subtasks). Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Audit item 4: atomic .ics/sidecar mutations (rollback on sidecar failure)

- Owner decision: make each store mutation all-or-nothing across the two on-disk files. Before, the `.ics` was written/removed first, then the sidecar; a sidecar-write failure (disk-full/EIO) left the `.ics`+memory changed but the sidecar stale — across a restart a lost tombstone could resurrect a deleted item or a lost dirty flag strand an edit.
- **Fix** (`internal/store/mutate.go`): new `revertMutation` restores the `.ics` (rewrite previous content, or remove for a create) plus the in-memory resource/conflict/tombstone maps to their pre-write state. `writeResource` and `remove` capture the prior state and call it when `writeSidecar` fails, then return the error — so the two files never diverge.
- Tests (`rollback_test.go`): sabotage the sidecar by replacing it with a directory (atomic rename fails, `.ics` write still works); `TestDeleteRollsBackOnSidecarFailure` (resource + no tombstone survive, and a later delete works) and `TestPutRollsBackOnSidecarFailure` (previous content kept, not left dirty). Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Audit item 3: one calendar's failure no longer aborts the whole sync

- Owner decision: a per-calendar download/REPORT failure should be recorded and skipped, not abort the entire sync — so a flaky calendar can't block healthy ones (with pending edits) from syncing.
- **Fix** (`internal/sync/sync.go`): the discovery loop now `recordSkip`s a failed `reconcileCalendar` and continues to the next calendar, instead of returning the error. A cancelled context still aborts the whole run (checked before skipping). `res.Calendars` counts only successfully-reconciled calendars.
- Tests (`sync_test.go`): fake gained a `failDownload` hook; `TestSyncSkipsFailedCalendarContinuesRest` puts the failing calendar first and asserts the healthy one still pushes its edit and the failure lands in `res.Skipped`. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Audit item 2: cross-list task move rolls back on partial failure

- Owner decision: make the cross-list yank/paste move **all-or-nothing**. Previously `moveSubtree` did Put(target)+Delete(source) per node and only recorded undo after the whole loop, so a mid-loop failure could leave nodes moved with no undo (or a node duplicated in both lists).
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/yankpaste.go`): accumulate a `rollback` list of reversals as each write commits (Put → `Forget` the copy; Delete → `Restore` the original, which clears its tombstone). On any error, run them newest-first so the subtree ends up entirely back in the source list; `yankUID` is kept so the user can retry. Undo is still pushed only on full success.
- Tests (`yankpaste_test.go`): `TestMoveSubtreeRollsBackOnFailure` forces a mid-move failure by making the source calendar dir read-only (source delete fails, dest Put succeeds) and asserts both nodes remain in the source with no stray copy in the dest (skips as root, where the perms trick doesn't hold). Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Audit item 1: confirm read-only before discarding a 403'd edit

- Owner decision on the reactive-403 data-loss risk: don't trust a bare 403 (it can be transient — auth blip, rate-limit, WAF, maintenance); re-check the calendar's privileges and only discard the stuck local edit when read-only is *confirmed*.
- **caldav** (`privileges.go`): new `Client.CalendarWritable(ctx, calPath)` — a Depth-0 `current-user-privilege-set` PROPFIND for one calendar (reusing the existing privilege parsing), fail-open on an ambiguous answer.
- **sync** (`sync.go`): `Syncer` gained `CalendarWritable`; `markReadOnlyDiscard` → `handleWriteForbidden` re-checks on a 403: confirmed read-only → flag + `Forget` (as before); still-writable or the check errored → **keep the local edit** and `recordSkip` a "kept local change, will retry" message. `pushUpdate` now takes the calendar path so it can re-check.
- Tests (`sync_test.go`): fake gained `CalendarWritable` (+ `writable`/`writableErr` maps); `TestSyncReactiveReadOnlyOn403` now sets the re-check to confirm read-only; new `TestSyncTransient403KeepsEdit` asserts a writable-on-recheck 403 keeps the edit and doesn't flag read-only. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Full-codebase audit: bug + undefined-behavior fixes

- Ran a parallel multi-agent audit of the whole codebase (model, store, caldav+sync, ui, config/cmd) for genuine bugs, undefined behaviors, and spec-vs-impl feature gaps. Fixed the genuine bugs and obvious undefined behaviors automatically; gaps and design-call items are reported to the owner separately.
- **[BUG] crash — `model.BuildTree` stack-overflow on a malformed cycle** (`tree.go`): a 2-cycle B↔C plus a third child of B made the unguarded `descends` walk recurse forever (violates never-crash-on-bad-.ics). Added a visited set (`descendsSeen`); cyclic nodes are safely orphaned. Regression test `TestBuildTreeCycleWithExtraChild`.
- **[BUG] recurrence — Windows/Outlook TZID on RDATE/EXDATE/RECURRENCE-ID broke expansion** (`recurrence.go`): these parsed via `prop.DateTime` (fails on non-IANA zones) instead of the resilient `resolveDateTime` used for DTSTART, so an Outlook event could blank the calendar or drop a series. Switched all three to `resolveDateTime`. Fixture `recur_exdate_winzone.ics` + `TestOccurrencesExdateWindowsZone`.
- **[BUG] sync — "keep server" on a locally-edited-but-remotely-deleted conflict was unresolvable** (`store/conflict.go`): empty `ServerData` → `model.Decode` EOF → error forever. Now treats empty ServerData as "accept the deletion" (`Forget`). Test `TestResolveKeepServerAcceptsRemoteDeletion`.
- **[BUG] caldav — update PUT with no stored ETag was unconditional** (`caldav/object.go`): `create=false && ifMatch==""` sent no precondition (blind overwrite). Now sends `If-Match: *` (condition on existence) so it can't resurrect a server-deleted resource.
- **[BUG] ui — folder completion rule bypassed by the edit form's Completed checkbox** (`edit.go`): `showTodoForm` Save called `EditTodo` (no child check). Added the same guard `Space` uses (`hasIncompleteChildren`).
- **[UNDEFINED] ui — tview style-tag injection in labels** (`render.go`, `conflicts.go`): only the Calendars panel escaped user text; task/calendar/list names, agenda titles, tree nodes, the detail pane, and conflict rows passed raw strings, so a name like `Review [draft]` mis-rendered (and the Tasks-panel `[ro]` marker never showed). Wrapped every user-supplied field in `tview.Escape`. Tests `TestDetailEscapesTagLikeText`, `TestTreeLabelEscapesTagLikeText`.
- **[UNDEFINED] ui — search Esc didn't re-collapse folders it auto-expanded** (`search.go`): `currentSelectionRestore` now snapshots/restores every node's expansion. Also fixed a focus-stack leak: Enter-on-match popped nothing, slowly growing `focusStack`.
- **[UNDEFINED] store — `CreateCalendarLocal` kept the caller's `components` slice** (`calendar.go`): now copies it (matching `SetCalendarComponents`).
- **[UNDEFINED] config — `password_command` failure hid the cause** (`config.go`): capture stderr and fold the first line into the error (e.g. "bw not logged in").
- Full gate (`build`/`vet`/`staticcheck`) + `go test -race ./...` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Color-path audit: RGB-based swatch matching (alpha/case-insensitive)

- Pre-commit sweep of the coloring behaviors for undefined edges. Findings were sound (new calendars render their color via `refresh`; `normalizeColor` matches `model.ParseHexColor`'s accepted forms; read-only calendars are guarded on every color path; blank-on-edit = unchanged) — except one.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/colorpicker.go`, `calendar.go`): the picker matched the calendar's current color to a swatch with `strings.EqualFold`, so a server color carrying an **alpha suffix** (NextCloud stores `#RRGGBBFF`) — or a different case / missing `#` — failed to preselect the swatch or draw the `✓`, silently landing on "Custom". Added `sameColor` (compares parsed RGB, ignoring alpha/case/`#`) and a `colorPicker.preselect` method used by both the opener and the `✓` render.
- Tests (`colorpicker_test.go`): `TestSameColor` (case/`#`/alpha variants), `TestColorPickerPreselect` (alpha color → swatch 6, non-palette → Custom, empty → first). Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Created calendars default to a palette color (never colorless)

- Owner report: creating a calendar/list without picking a color left it colorless (app default). It should always get a color.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/colorpicker.go`, `calendar.go`): new `defaultCalendarColor = "#0082c9"` (NextCloud blue, a palette swatch). The create form's Color field is pre-seeded with it (so it's visible and the picker preselects it), and `createCalendarWithColor` falls back to it when the field is blank — so every created collection always has a color. Edit is unaffected (blank there still means "leave unchanged").
- Docs: `main.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- Tests (`colorpicker_test.go`): `TestCalendarCreateDefaultsColor` — creating with an empty color yields `defaultCalendarColor`. Full gate + `go test -race ./internal/ui` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Color built into the calendar create/edit form (fixes colorless new calendars)

- Owner report + request: creating a calendar/list **never assigned a color** (it showed the default until manually recolored in NextCloud), and the color picker should be **part of the create/edit GUI** rather than a chained step. Root cause: `createCollection` called `CreateCalendarLocal` with `CalendarMeta{DisplayName: name}` — no color — so a new calendar (and its MKCALENDAR) carried none.
- **Unified form** (`internal/ui/calendar.go`): replaced `createCollection` with `showCalendarForm(editID, defaultType)` — one form for create *and* edit. Fields: Name, Type (create only; a calendar's component set can't change on the server), and a **Color** hex field with a **"Pick color…"** button that opens the swatch grid; the pick is written back into the field (which also accepts a typed hex). Create passes the color to `CreateCalendarLocal` (new `createCalendarWithColor` seam), so it's set from the start and carried in the MKCALENDAR; Save uses `UpdateCalendarMeta(name, color)`. `e` on the Calendars pane now opens this edit form (was: the bare picker).
- **Nested modals** (`internal/ui/edit.go`, `app.go`): the picker opens *over* the form, so modal focus save/restore became a **stack** (`focusStack []focusState`, push in `captureFocus` / pop in `restoreFocus`) instead of a single slot — backward-compatible for the existing single-level modals, and it lets form→picker→custom-hex-prompt nest and unwind cleanly.
- **Picker opener** refactored into `openColorPickerCallback(current, title, onPick)` (shared by the form's Pick button and the direct `:calendar color` recolor); `openColorPicker(calID)` now wraps it with `applyCalendarColor`. `:calendar color` no-arg still opens the picker; with a hex still sets directly.
- Docs: help overlay, `main.md` (Color section + `e` row), `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`.
- Tests (`colorpicker_test.go`): `TestCalendarFormCreatesWithColor` (create seam stores the color + PendingCreate), `TestFocusStackNesting` (push/pop balance, extra pop is safe), `TestEditOnCalendarsPaneOpensForm` (was OpensPicker). Verified headlessly: the create form renders Name/Type/Color + Pick color…/Create/Cancel, and a nested picker-over-form opens both pages then unwinds leaving the form intact. Full gate (`build`/`vet`/`staticcheck`) + `go test -race ./internal/ui` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Swatch-grid color picker for calendars (create + edit)

- Owner request: pick a calendar color in the UI instead of typing a hex. Chosen (via Q&A): a **swatch-grid picker** with a "Custom hex…" escape hatch, reachable when creating a calendar, from `e` on the Calendars pane, and from `:calendar color` with no hex.
- **Picker widget** (`internal/ui/colorpicker.go`): a custom tview `Box` primitive drawing `calendarPalette` (a 15-color NextCloud-like preset set, incl. NextCloud blue `#0082c9`) as a 5×3 grid of color-filled cells, a trailing "Custom hex…" entry, and a "current: #…" hint. Cursor is accent brackets around the selected swatch; the calendar's current color is marked with a contrasting `✓`. `hjkl`/arrows move (grid + drop-to/return-from Custom), `Enter` selects, `Esc` cancels — via `onSelect`/`onCustom`/`onCancel` callbacks.
- **Wiring** (`internal/ui/calendar.go`): `openColorPicker(calID)` preselects the current color (or the first swatch for a new calendar), applies a pick via `applyCalendarColor` (offline-first `UpdateCalendarMeta`, pushed as PROPPATCH on next sync — same path as `:calendar color`), and routes "Custom hex…" to `promptInput` + `normalizeColor`. It's a **standalone modal** (never nested — `openModal` uses a single saved-focus), so `createCollection` chains into it after the name/type form, and `editSelected` opens it when `e` is pressed on the Calendars pane with no item drilled. `cmdCalendar` "color" opens the picker with no arg and sets directly with a hex (backward compatible), sharing `applyCalendarColor`.
- Docs: help overlay (`e` + `:calendar`), `main.md` (Creation/Color section, `e` keymap row, `:calendar` command), `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`.
- Tests (`colorpicker_test.go`): picker navigation (grid clamps, drop-to/return-from Custom), select/custom/cancel callbacks, `applyCalendarColor` sets the stored color, `e` on the Calendars pane opens the picker, and `:calendar color` routes (hex sets directly, no-arg opens the picker). Verified the render visually (5×3 grid, cursor brackets, `✓` on the current color, Custom entry). Full gate (`build`/`vet`/`staticcheck`) + `go test -race ./internal/ui` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — `:config` reload now applies color_mode live

- Follow-up to the truecolor change: `:config` (edit in `$EDITOR`, reload on exit) previously re-applied only the `[server]` connection; a `color_mode` change needed a full restart. Now it applies live.
- **Reload payload** (`internal/ui/app.go`): the `EditConfig` callback now returns a `ConfigReload{Sync, ColorMode}` struct instead of a bare sync closure — keeps config parsing in `main` (architecture rule) while letting the UI apply more than one reloaded setting.
- **Apply** (`internal/ui/command.go` `applyConfigReload`): still swaps the sync closure; additionally re-parses `color_mode` and, when it changed, updates `a.colorMode` and rebuilds the color index + Calendars list (the list bullets bake in the color tag; center views read the index live and repaint on resume). The highlighted calendar row is preserved across the rebuild. `auto`↔`truecolor` is a no-op for the mode (both parse to colorAuto) — 24-bit output is negotiated at tcell init, so that specific switch still needs a restart (documented).
- **main** (`cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`): `editConfigFn` returns `ui.ConfigReload{Sync: buildSyncFn(...), ColorMode: cfg.Appearance.ColorMode}`; the account-change guard is unchanged. Dropped the now-unused `sync` import from `command.go`.
- Docs: `README.md` (`:config` note — color_mode applies live, auto↔truecolor/account need restart), `main.md` config-editing decision.
- Tests (`configreload_test.go`): migrated the two existing tests to the `ConfigReload` signature; added `TestApplyConfigReloadAppliesColorMode` — a reload to `off` clears a calendar's color from the index, and back to `16` repopulates it, with `a.colorMode` tracking each change. Full gate (`build`/`vet`/`staticcheck`) + `go test -race ./internal/ui` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Truecolor calendar colors (exact NextCloud hex) with 16-color fallback

- Owner request: move off the nearest-of-16 color mapping (which collapsed NextCloud's several blues/greens onto the same terminal color) to render the **exact** server hex. Chosen approach (via Q&A): **truecolor RGB with tcell auto-downsampling** (not a hand-built 256 table — tcell degrades RGB to 256/16 per terminal, incl. a bare TTY, in one code path), plus a **readability floor** and a **`color_mode` config knob**.
- **Model** (`internal/model/color.go`): added `ParseHexColor` (exported hex→RGB), `Luminance` (Rec. 601), and `ReadableFg` — lifts a dark color toward white until it clears a luminance floor (`minReadableLum = 96`). Kept `NearestANSI16`/`ANSI16IsDark` for the 16-color mode. The floor exists because item colors are drawn as **foreground text on the terminal's unknown default background**; a dark navy would otherwise be invisible on a dark terminal (assumes dark bg — the `16` mode is the light-terminal escape hatch).
- **UI** (`internal/ui/color.go`): `calColor` now carries both `fill` (exact color, for event-block backgrounds, which supply their own contrasting text) and `fg` (readability-lifted, for bullets/day-cell lines/agenda titles). New `colorMode` enum (`auto`/`16`/`off`) + `parseColorMode`; `resolveCalColor(hex, mode)` builds truecolor RGB in `auto`, nearest-ANSI named color in `16`, nothing in `off`. Only `drawBlock` uses `fill`; every other site already used `fg`. `dark` now reflects the exact fill's luminance.
- **Config** (`internal/config`): `[appearance] color_mode` (default `auto`; `truecolor`/`16`/`off`), added to `Default()` and the first-run template. Wired through `ui.Options.ColorMode`. `main.go` force-enables tcell truecolor (`COLORTERM=truecolor`) when `color_mode = "truecolor"`, for terminals that underreport; the UI renders RGB either way.
- Docs: `main.md` (Colors design note rewritten + calendar-metadata decision + config scope), `CLAUDE.md` UI line, `README.md` (calendars bullet + an `[appearance]`/`color_mode` note), config template. This reverses the earlier "terminal 16-color palette only" decision — recorded as such.
- Tests: model — `ParseHexColor`, `ReadableFg` (bright unchanged, dark lifted to the floor, white safe), `Luminance` via existing; ui — `resolveCalColor` per mode (exact truecolor + fill/fg split, dark color's fg lifted while fill stays exact, `16` named, `off`/empty don't resolve), `parseColorMode` table, and the render tests migrated to bright colors + `.Hex()` comparisons (SimulationScreen preserves the RGB value); config — default `color_mode == "auto"`. Full gate (`build`/`vet`/`staticcheck`) + `go test -race ./internal/ui ./internal/model ./internal/config` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Week/day time-grid: `+`/`-` zoom the hour-row height (remembered)

- Owner follow-up to the uniform-hour change: let the hour-row height be adjusted, with `+`/`-`, and remember it between sessions. The `vScale` rework already renders any rows-per-hour with correct scrolling, so this is purely a control surface + persistence.
- **Zoom override** (`internal/ui/timegridview.go`): `timeGridView` gained `rowsPerHour` (explicit zoom, 0 = auto-fit) and `lastRowsPerHour` (the value actually drawn). `newVScale` uses the override when set, else the auto-fit `bodyH/24`, and records `lastRowsPerHour`. Bounds `minRowsPerHour=1`/`maxRowsPerHour=12` + `clampRowsPerHour`.
- **Contextual `+`/`-`** (`internal/ui/app.go`, `keys.go`): `+`/`-` were the accordion. Now, when the week/day time-grid is the active view (`timeGridActive`), they call `zoomHour(±1)`; in every other view (month/tasks/agenda, where hour-zoom is meaningless) they keep driving the accordion. `zoomHour` steps from the height currently in effect (explicit zoom, else the last auto-fit drawn), clamps, mirrors onto the grid, flashes "Hour rows: N", and persists.
- **Persistence** (`internal/state`, `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `ui.Options`): `state.State` gained `RowsPerHour`; the `SaveState` callback signature is now `func(leftWidth int, hidden []string, rowsPerHour int)` and `ui.Options` carries `RowsPerHour`. `app.hourRows` seeds the grid at build and is written by `persistState` alongside pane width + hidden calendars. Taller hours simply scroll more of the day off-screen (the scroll machinery already handles it).
- Docs: help overlay, `main.md` (keymap `+`/`-` row, Week/Day view, pane-sizing note), `CLAUDE.md` UI line, `README.md`.
- Tests: `state` round-trip covers `RowsPerHour`; `sizing_test.go` `TestZoomHourAdjustsClampsAndPersists` (auto→2, clamps to max/min, persists); `keys_test.go` `TestPlusMinusContextual` (`+` zooms in week view / accordions in month view); `timegridview_test.go` `TestTimeGridRowsPerHourOverride` (explicit 3 → uniform 3-row spacing, `lastRowsPerHour` recorded). Migrated the four `saveState` stubs to the new signature. Full gate (`build`/`vet`/`staticcheck`) + `go test -race ./internal/ui ./internal/state` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Week/day time-grid: uniform hour heights (even axis) + scroll when short

- Owner report: vertical hour spacing in the week/day view was uneven — the mapping `row = bodyY + hour*bodyH/24` error-diffuses the remainder, so adjacent hours differed by a row (e.g. a repeating 1-2-2 gap pattern) whenever the pane height wasn't a multiple of 24. Owner chose **uniform hour heights**, and confirmed **scrolling is fine** when the whole day can't fit.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/timegridview.go`): replaced the fill-the-pane float scaling with a uniform `rowsPerHour` grid. New `vScale{bodyY, bodyH, rowsPerHour, scroll}` + `vScale.row(hourFloat)` maps hours to rows; `newVScale` picks `rph = max(1, bodyH/24)` — the largest whole rows-per-hour that fits — so every hour is exactly `rph` rows tall (evenly spaced), leaving a small blank margin below the last hour when `bodyH` isn't a whole number of hours. When even one row per hour overflows the pane (`24*rph > bodyH`, i.e. a very short body), the grid **scrolls**: `newVScale` centers `anchorHour()` — the drilled timed item's time, else the current time when a shown day is today, else mid-morning (`defaultAnchorHour = 8`) — clamped to the ends. `drawBlock`/`drawTaskMarker` now take the `vScale`, map through it, and clip to the visible pane (a block partly scrolled out is clipped; a marker fully out is skipped). Column separators stop at the grid's bottom so the blank margin stays clean. Navigation is unaffected (it's logical lane/time-based via `model.LayoutDay`); scroll is recomputed each draw from the selection, so a drilled item stays in view automatically.
- Docs: `main.md` Week/Day view + `CLAUDE.md` UI line (uniform hour heights, blank margin, short-pane scroll) — replaced the old "scaled to fill the pane height (no scrolling)" wording. README's time-grid description is high-level and unaffected.
- Tests (`timegridview_test.go`): `hourLabelRows` helper (exact gutter match, so "1am" ≠ "11am"); `TestTimeGridUniformHourSpacing` renders a body where the old mapping gave mixed gaps and asserts a constant 2 rows/hour across all 24 labels; `TestTimeGridScrollsShortPaneToDrilledItem` — a 9pm event is off-screen on a short pane and scrolls into view when drilled. Verified visually at heights 40 (rph 1) and 60 (rph 2): even axis, proportional blocks, clean bottom margin. Full gate (`build`/`vet`/`staticcheck`) + `go test -race ./internal/ui` pass.

## 2026-07-10 — Month view: "+N more" indicator at the top too (items hidden above)

- Owner request: the month grid already drew a `+N more` line at the **bottom** of an overflowing day cell (items below the scrolled window, correctly shrinking as you drill down); add the mirror-image `+N more` at the **top** once the window has scrolled down far enough to hide items above.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/calendarview.go` `drawCell`): reworked the overflow render. A `drawItem`/`drawMore` closure pair removes the duplicated item-draw logic. When a day overflows and the cell has room for both markers (`avail >= 3`), the scroll window is chosen by regime — at the top of the list only a bottom marker shows, at the bottom only a top marker, in the middle both (selection pinned to the last item row, matching the prior single-indicator feel). The top marker counts items above the window (`start`), the bottom counts items below (`n - end`); each shrinks and disappears as you drill toward that edge, and the drilled item is always fully visible (never hidden under a marker). Cells too short for two markers (`avail < 3`) keep the original single bottom-indicator scroll behavior.
- Docs: `main.md` Month-view description updated (top + bottom `+N more`). README/CLAUDE.md don't mention the marker, so unchanged.
- Tests (`calendarview_test.go`): added `rowStrings`/`firstRowContaining` helpers; reworked `TestMonthGridOverflowIndicatorReflectsBelow` to assert the *below*-window marker specifically (sits below the first item at the top, gone once the last item is reached) and added `TestMonthGridTopOverflowIndicator` (drilled to the bottom, a `+N more` marker appears above the first visible item and Task0 is scrolled off the top). Existing scroll-to-drilled-item test unchanged. Full gate (`build`/`vet`/`staticcheck`) + `go test -race ./internal/ui` pass.

## 2026-07-09 — Calendar navigation overhaul: spatial 2D drill + f/b stays drilled

- Owner revised calendar-pane navigation. Rules now:
  - **Un-drilled week/day**: `h`/`l`/`←`/`→` move between days; `j`/`k`/`↑`/`↓` do **nothing** (days are horizontal). `Enter` drills in. Month un-drilled unchanged (2D day cursor, `↑`/`↓` = ±week).
  - **Drilled week/day**: fully **2D spatial** navigation of the day's on-screen layout — `j`/`k` move by time; `h`/`l` move between **concurrent** events (the side-by-side overlap lanes). Example: A (11–12, full width) above B/C (12–1, concurrent) → `↓` from A lands on B, `→`/`←` toggles B/C, `↑` returns to A. Deterministic (was a flat time-ordered list, so concurrent order was a non-deterministic title tiebreak). The all-day band is the top row (`h`/`l` between its items; `↓` enters the timed grid, `↑` from the top timed row returns to it); timed due-task markers are single-lane rows in the vertical flow. Movement stops at the day's edges.
  - **Drilled month**: 1D (the day's item list) — `j`/`k` cycle, `h`/`l` do nothing.
  - **`f`/`b`**: the way to change day/week/month; now **stays drilled**, re-entering on the new period's day (first item), or dropping to day nav if it has none.
- **Impl** (`timegridview.go`): new `navCell`/`navCells` spatial model built from `model.LayoutDay` lanes + start times; `spatialTarget`/`spatialMove` for up/down (by time level, nearest lane) and left/right (adjacent lane among overlapping events, or between band items). `handleEventMode` now calls these; `handleDayMode` no longer drills on `↑`/`↓`. `calendarview.go`: month drill drops `←`/`→` (stays 1D). `app.go` `shiftAnchor`: capture drill state, re-drill after the period change.
- Tests (`timegridview_test.go`, `taskcalendar_test.go`): the A/B/C spatial example (`↓`/`↑`/`←`/`→` + edge stop), un-drilled `↓` does nothing / `Enter` drills, all-day-band→timed drill order, and `f` stays drilled onto the next day's task. Full gate + `-race` pass.
- Memory: recorded the spatial-drill design + rules ([[calendar-drill-navigation]]).

## 2026-07-09 — Month overflow "+N more" now counts items below the window

- Follow-up to the drill-scroll fix: `+N more` counted every item *outside* the window (including ones scrolled off the top), so it lingered even after drilling to the bottommost item. Owner wanted it to update/disappear as you drill down.
- **Fix** (`calendarview.go` `drawCell`): the indicator now counts only items **below** the window (`n - end`) and is drawn only when that's > 0. So it shrinks as you drill down and vanishes once the last item is selected; items scrolled off the top are still reachable by drilling back up. (The reserved row is simply left blank at the bottom.)
- Tests (`calendarview_test.go`): with an overflowing day, `+N more` shows at the top and is gone when the bottom item is drilled. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-09 — Fix: month view lost the highlight when drilling into overflow items

- Owner report: on the month view, a day with more items than fit its cell drew the first few + a `+N more` line from the top; drilling (event-cycling) to an item in the overflow region left it **undrawn**, so the highlight vanished and you couldn't tell where the cursor was.
- **Fix** (`calendarview.go` `drawCell`): the day cell now **scrolls its visible window to the drilled item**. When the day is selected and in event mode, the window `[start, start+capItems)` is positioned so `eventIndex` is always inside it (`capItems` = rows minus one reserved for the indicator). Non-drilled days still render from the top as before. The `+N more` count now reports every item outside the window (above when scrolled, below otherwise) — and since the cursor is always inside the window, it's never hidden. Week/day was unaffected (blocks/markers draw at their time position, always visible).
- Tests (`calendarview_test.go`): a day with 8 items drilled to index 6 renders `Task6` on screen with the reverse (highlight) attribute — would fail before the fix (only the first ~3 drew). Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-09 — Folder caret (▸) consistent across all views; folders keep due dates

- Owner design question: should folders render due dates (intuition: no), and doesn't hiding them make a dated task vanish from the calendar the moment it gains a subtask? Resolution (agreed): **folders keep their due dates** — a folder is still a real dated task (a deadline'd project with sub-steps), hiding it would lose user-set data and cause exactly that vanish. The rule stays uniform: a task shows on the calendar iff it has a due date, folder or not. Consistency instead comes from rendering the **folder metaphor** everywhere.
- **Global folder set** (`render.go`): replaced the per-list `treeFolders` with one global `a.folders` (`rebuildFolders` = `folderSet(store.Todos())`, run in `buildCalendars` and `buildTreeForList`), plus `isFolder(uid)`. Folder-ness of a task is the same in every view now (children share the parent's collection, so global == per-list for any UID).
- **Folder caret in calendar + agenda** (owner asked for the same caret as the Tasks pane): new shared `todoMark(t, folder)` → `▸` folder / `[■]` done / `[ ]` incomplete. Wired into the month-grid cells (`itemLabel`), week/day markers + all-day band (`taskMarkerLabel`), and the agenda list (`agendaLeftLabel`, now a method); the month/time-grid get an `isFolder` closure. The tree keeps its expand-aware `▸`/`▾`. So a dated task that gains a child now shows `▸ Proj` on the calendar (stays put, doesn't vanish) instead of `[ ]`.
- The completion gate was already view-independent (`toggleComplete` → `hasIncompleteChildren`), so Space on a folder in any view still refuses until its children are done.
- Docs: `README.md`, `main.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (folders keep due dates; ▸ caret across views).
- Tests (`taskcalendar_test.go`): a dated task with an incomplete child is a folder, still appears in the day's items, and renders `▸` in the month cell, agenda label, and week/day marker. Migrated `app_test.go` off `treeFolders`. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-09 — Fix: completing a drilled task no longer undrills the calendar day

- Owner report: in a calendar view, Space-to-complete kicked you back out to day navigation. Cause: `toggleComplete` ends in `refresh`, which rebuilds the grid (`setData` resets `eventMode`/`eventIndex`), dropping the drill. The modal create/edit/delete paths already re-drill via `captureFocus`/`restoreFocus`, but Space mutates directly with no modal.
- **Fix** (`edit.go`): new `refreshKeepingDrill` captures the grid's `drillState` before the rebuild and `reDrill`s the same day/index after (calendar mode only; a plain `refresh` elsewhere). `toggleComplete` uses it. The completed task stays in the day's items (calendar views don't hide completed), so the same index re-selects it, now shown `[■]`.
- Tests (`taskcalendar_test.go`): after Space-complete, the month grid stays in `eventMode` with `currentTarget` still the task, and the week grid keeps its task selection. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-09 — Manage tasks from the calendar views (check off · subtasks anywhere)

- Owner revised the "tasks are managed only from the Tasks pane" decision (it conflicted with the max-power philosophy). Three changes:
- **Check off a drilled task with Space in any calendar view** (`app.go`): in Calendar mode Space is now contextual — if a task is drilled/selected it toggles done, otherwise it toggles the highlighted calendar's visibility (unchanged when no task is selected or on an event). Agenda already checked off the selected task; the month grid already exposed the drilled item via `currentTarget`, so it just needed the Space routing.
- **Week/day tasks are now selectable** (`timegridview.go`): the time-grid drill was `Occurrence`-based (events only), so tasks weren't reachable there. Reworked it onto `model.AgendaItem` — the drill now cycles the day's events **and** due tasks (agenda order), matching the month grid. Added a per-day `items` drill list (`dayItemsForDays`, from `dayItems`), `selectedItem()` (replacing `selectedOcc`), task-marker highlight when selected, and all-day-band highlight for a selected all-day item (event or task). `currentTarget` now resolves the time-grid's drilled item too, so **edit/delete/complete all work on tasks in week/day** as well. This also makes the two grids structurally alike (helps the selection/focus glue noted earlier).
- **Subtasks created under the selected task in any context** (`edit.go`): dropped the Tasks-mode gate; `subtaskContext` now takes the parent from `currentTarget` (tree, calendar drill, or agenda) and creates the subtask in the **parent's own calendar** (via `store.Locate`) — never the Tasks-overview highlight — since RELATED-TO parent/child must share a collection.
- Not changed (already correct): top-level task creation targets the selected task list and event creation the selected calendar, from any pane (independent overview selectors); a "both" calendar already appears in both overview panes.
- Docs: `README.md`, `main.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (Space contextual, week/day task drill, subtask-anywhere). Memory: updated [[create-targets-independent-overviews]] and [[creation-gated-by-component-set]].
- Tests: `timegridview_test.go` migrated to the AgendaItem drill; `taskcalendar_test.go` — Space checks off a drilled task in the month grid and the week grid, and `subtaskContext` under a calendar-drilled task targets the parent's list. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-09 — Week/day grid: vertical motion cycles the day's events (counts work)

- Owner review of the count feature: `<count>` repeats motions and `<count>G` jumps to the Nth **list** item, but the week/day time-grid had **no vertical motion** (`j`/`k`/`↑`/`↓` were unbound — only `h`/`l` moved days), so counts were dead there and `j`/`k` felt broken.
- Decisions: keep `<count>G` = Nth item **lists-only** (tree/grids treat `G` as bottom; docs already say "nth list item"); add vertical motion to the week/day grid that **cycles the selected day's events**.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/timegridview.go`): day-mode `↑`/`↓` now call `enterEventMode` — drill into the day's events (all-day first, then timed), selecting the first; once in event mode `handleEventMode` advances the cursor. Since `globalKeys` translates `hjkl`→arrows and `repeatKey` replays the arrow N times, a count like `2j` lands on the 2nd event for free (first press enters at index 0, the second advances). Horizontal `h`/`l` still move between days.
- Docs: `README.md`, `main.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (week/day vertical keys cycle events; counts work).
- Tests (`timegridview_test.go`): `↓` drills into events (first), a second `↓` advances, `↑` goes back. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-09 — Fix: `gg`/`G` in the task tree (+ stale tree on programmatic list select)

- Owner report: still couldn't use `gg`/`G` in the Tasks pane. Two distinct causes found:
- **Tree `gg`/`G` were scroll-only** (`internal/ui/keys.go`): `gotoTop`/`gotoBottom` feed `Home`/`End`, which tview's `List` honors — but its `TreeView.process()` has no `treeHome`/`treeEnd` case, so `Home`/`End` (and tview's native `g`/`G`) only adjust the scroll offset and never move the selection. So even after diving into the tree (`Enter`), `gg`/`G` did nothing visible. Fix: when the focused widget is the tree, select the first / last visible node directly via `SetCurrentNode` (new `visibleTreeNodes` walks selectable nodes in display order, descending only into expanded folders). Lists and the calendar grids are unchanged.
- **Stale tree on programmatic list selection** (`app.go` tasklists changed-callback, `render.go`): selecting a task list with `{`/`}` (or any `SetCurrentItem`) rebuilt the *previously* selected list's tree — tview fires `List.changed` **before** updating `GetCurrentItem`, and `buildTree()` read the stale current item. Split out `buildTreeForList(id)` and have the changed-callback build for the callback's `index` argument (always the new selection). This also means `{`/`}` now actually switch the visible tree, not just the highlight.
- Note (focus model, not a bug): `t` focuses the task-**list** column; `Enter` dives into the **tree**, where `gg`/`G`/`j`/`k` navigate tasks; `Esc` backs out.
- Tests (`keys_test.go`): `gg`/`G` move the tree cursor to first/last node; cycling to a list with `}` shows *that* list's tree (root name); plus the existing month-grid and bracket/brace tests. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-09 — Fix: `gg`/`G` were dead in the calendar grid

- Owner report: `gg`/`G` weren't properly implemented. Root cause: `gotoTop`/`gotoBottom` feed `Home`/`End` to the focused primitive, which tview's `List` and `TreeView` handle — so the overview lists and task tree already worked — but the **custom calendar widgets** (`calendarView` month grid, `timeGridView` week/day) had no `Home`/`End` handling, so once you `Enter`-dived into a grid, `gg`/`G` did nothing (confirmed via a headless probe: the month selection didn't move).
- **Fix**: `calendarView` and `timeGridView` now handle `Home`/`End` in both day-mode and event-mode. Day-mode: `gg` selects the first grid cell / first day-column, `G` the last (reusing the existing `onSelectDay`). Event-mode (drilled into a day): `gg`/`G` jump to the first / last event of that day. No change to `keys.go` — the app's `gotoTop`/`gotoBottom` already feed `Home`/`End`, so making the widgets honor them is all it took (consistent with the "reuse the widget's own navigation" design).
- Docs: `README.md` / `main.md` `gg`/`G` rows note they cover the calendar grid too.
- Tests: `keys_test.go` drives `gg`/`G` through `globalKeys` with the month grid focused (lands on first/last grid day); `calendarview_test.go` event-mode `Home`/`End` → first/last event; `timegridview_test.go` week `Home`/`End` → first/last day. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-09 — Global overview selectors: `[`/`]` calendar, `{`/`}` task list

- Owner request: make the bracket keys global calendar selectors and add curly braces as global task-list selectors, so either overview's highlight can be nudged from any pane (matching the existing independent-overview-targeting design, cf. create-event/create-task).
- **Keys** (`internal/ui/app.go` `globalKeys`): dropped the `a.mode == modeCalendar` guard on `[`/`]` so they cycle the Calendars highlight in every mode; added `{`/`}` → new `cycleTasklist`, the task-list counterpart to `cycleCalendar`. Both intercept at the app level (before the focused widget), so they work whether focus sits in an overview list or a dived-in grid; neither the tree nor the lists bind these keys, so nothing regresses.
- **`cycleTasklist`** cycles within `len(a.tasklistIDs)` (skipping the "(no task lists)" placeholder) and `SetCurrentItem`, which fires the tasklists changed-callback — so when Tasks mode is showing, the tree rebuilds for the newly-highlighted list; in other modes it just moves the (always-visible) left-column highlight, which is the target for the next action.
- Docs: help overlay (moved `[`/`]` into Panels & navigation and added `{`/`}`), controls line, `README.md`, `main.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- Tests (`keys_test.go` `TestBracketAndBraceCycleGlobally`): from Agenda mode (neither Calendar nor Tasks), `]`/`[` cycle the calendar highlight and `}`/`{` cycle the task-list highlight, wrapping back; creates a second VTODO list so the cycle has somewhere to go. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-09 — Unify the due-task checkbox across calendar views

- Owner report: inconsistent glyphs — the month view showed an uncompleted due task as `[ ]`, but the new week/day time-grid marked it with `◆` (and `◆ [■]` when completed). Task management lives in the Tasks pane, so the calendar views should just render tasks uniformly.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/timegridview.go` `taskMarkerLabel`): the time-grid due-task line now uses the same checkbox convention as the month grid and task tree — `[ ]` uncompleted, `[■]` completed — dropping the `◆`. The line is still foreground-only text (not a filled block), which already sets a due task apart from an event.
- Docs: `README.md`, `main.md`, `CLAUDE.md` updated (checkbox, not `◆`).
- Tests (`timegridview_test.go`): asserts `[ ] Payrent` / `[ ] Renewpass` render (was `◆`); color assertion unchanged. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-09 — Show due tasks in the week/day time-grid (colored by list)

- Follow-up to the color work: due tasks were colored where they already showed (month grid, agenda) but the **week/day time-grid rendered events only** (`splitOccs` pulls event occurrences, never todos), so a task's due date was invisible in the hourly view. Owner chose to place a timed due task **at its due time**.
- **Time-grid** (`internal/ui/timegridview.go`): new `dueTasks map[string][]*model.Todo` + `taskColor` resolver. A **timed** due task draws a one-row `◆`-prefixed marker at its due hour (same hour→row mapping as event blocks), a foreground marker (no fill) so it reads as a due task distinct from the filled event blocks and can sit over an event at that time; an **all-day-due** task sits in the top all-day band alongside all-day events (lead item + `+N`). Both use the list's color (aqua fallback), and a completed one shows `◆ [■]`. `dueParts` splits a day's tasks into all-day vs timed. Markers are display-only — the `Enter` drill cycle still covers events (tasks aren't `Occurrence`s); the day's tasks remain in the Detail pane and month/agenda.
- **Wiring** (`render.go` `dueTasksByDay`, `app.go`, `color.go`): buckets tasks with a due date onto their due day for the visible range, excluding hidden calendars (via `TodosVisible`) and including completed ones (matching the month grid/agenda). `a.timegrid.taskColor = a.todoColor` (UID → list color).
- Docs: `README.md` (week/day now shows due tasks), `main.md` (Week/Day view), `CLAUDE.md` UI line.
- Tests (`timegridview_test.go`): a timed due task renders a `◆` marker at its due time in the list color (red) and an all-day-due task appears in the band. Full gate + `-race` pass. (Also confirmed en route — via a throwaway harness — that the month grid and agenda were already coloring due tasks from the previous change; no change needed there.)

## 2026-07-09 — Sync calendar colors from the server + render them everywhere

- Owner request: colors were **push-only** (in-app `:calendar color` → PROPPATCH; MKCALENDAR on create), never pulled, and were **never rendered** — events drew a fixed green, tasks aqua, and there was no palette mapping. Closed the gap both ways: pull the server's color, and draw every calendar's items in it. Fulfils the long-standing `main.md` intent ("server calendar colors are mapped to the nearest palette color").
- **Pull** (`internal/caldav/colors.go`, `client.go`): new `discoverColors` issues a Depth-1 PROPFIND for the Apple `calendar-color` under the calendar home set (over our own authenticated client, like the privilege/MKCALENDAR gap-fillers), best-effort so a failed/unsupported query never breaks discovery. `caldav.Calendar` gained a `Color` field, populated in `DiscoverCalendars`.
- **Store** (`internal/store/calendar.go`): `SyncCalendarColor(id, serverColor)` adopts the server color, **server-authoritative except when a local color edit is still pending** a PROPPATCH (that edit wins until pushed, so a routine pull can't clobber it); no-op on empty/unchanged (no needless sidecar rewrite), mirroring `SetCalendarComponents`/`SetCalendarReadOnly`.
- **Sync/import** (`internal/sync/{sync,import}.go`): `Sync` calls `SyncCalendarColor` per calendar during discovery (push-props already runs first, so a just-pushed color re-affirms rather than conflicts); `Import` records `cal.Color` in the initial `SetCalendarMeta`.
- **Mapping** (`internal/model/color.go`): pure `NearestANSI16(hex)` (nearest of the 16 ANSI colors by RGB distance; accepts `#rrggbb`/`#rrggbbaa`, alpha ignored) + `ANSI16IsDark(idx)` (Rec. 601 luminance) for fill contrast. Keeps LazyPlanner on the terminal palette (inherits the theme) — no truecolor.
- **Render** (`internal/ui`): new `color.go` maps a palette index → tcell named color + tview tag name + dark flag, and builds a calendar-id→color and item-UID→color index (`rebuildColorIndex`, run in `buildCalendars`). Applied in: the **Calendars list** (a `●` bullet in the calendar's color), the **month grid** day-cell lines, the **week/day time-grid** (event blocks filled with the color, contrasting black/white text; all-day band tinted), and the **agenda** title lines. Non-colored calendars keep the green/aqua defaults.
- **Bug found & fixed in passing**: the Calendars list's `[both]`/`[ro]`/`[events]`/`[tasks]` markers were **silently swallowed** by tview's style-tag parser (they live in the label string — why the string-contains tests passed — but never drew; only `[?]` survived, since `?` isn't a valid tag char). Now the description is `tview.Escape`d so the markers render literally, with the color bullet prepended as the one real tag.
- Tests: caldav — `discoverColors` (PROPFIND method/depth/body, set vs unset color); model — `NearestANSI16` table + `ANSI16IsDark`; sync — pulls a server color, and does **not** clobber a pending local recolor (pushes it instead); ui — `resolveCalColor`, the Calendars bullet renders red + `[both]` now renders literally, and the agenda title draws in the calendar color (SimulationScreen). Updated two marker tests to assert the escaped (now-visible) form. Full gate (build/vet/staticcheck) + `go test -race ./...` pass.

## 2026-07-08 — `i!` force override for creating on unknown-type calendars

- Owner request: a manual escape hatch from the block-until-known creation gate, for a calendar whose type isn't confirmed (`[?]`). Read-only stays hard-locked (no override), and a *known* wrong type is still refused.
- **Force chord** (`internal/ui/keys.go` `resolvePrefix`): after the `i` create prefix, `!` arms a one-shot force and keeps the prefix pending, so `i!e`/`i!t`/`i!s` (and the `i!E`/`i!T`/`i!S` full-form variants) force the create. New `pendingForce` (armed) and `forceCreate` (set for the duration of the action) app flags; the which-key hint shows `new (force)` and the command view echoes `i!e`. `startPrefix`/`clearPrefix` reset the flag.
- **Gate** (`calendar.go` `guardComponent`): honors `forceCreate` **only** in the unknown-type branch (empty component set → allow). A known wrong type still returns false regardless of force, and read-only is unaffected because `guardWrite` (checked first, ignores force) handles it. Blocked-flash now hints "(i! to force)".
- Docs: help overlay (`i ! e / i ! t` row), `main.md` (`i` keymap row + Creation section), `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`. Memory: recorded the gating + force boundaries ([[creation-gated-by-component-set]]).
- Tests (`calendar_test.go`): `guardComponent` under `forceCreate` allows unknown-type but not a known wrong type; the `i` `!` `e` sequence arms force (prefix stays pending) and opens the event prompt on the fixture's unknown-type `work` calendar, while a plain `ie` there is refused. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-08 — hjkl move the highlight in every pane (incl. the overview lists)

- Follow-up: the keymap advertised `hjkl` as movement, but the three overview lists (Calendars/Tasks/Agenda) took **arrows only** — tview's `List` binds no `hjkl` (and `TreeView` binds `j`/`k` but not `h`/`l`). So `hjkl` movement was inconsistent across panes.
- **Fix** (`internal/ui/keys.go` `motionArrow`, `app.go` `globalKeys`): `hjkl` are now global **aliases for the arrow keys** — after the modal guard (so typing into forms is unaffected) and the count accumulator, a movement key is translated to its arrow and fed to the focused widget. `h`→Left, `j`→Down, `k`→Up, `l`→Right. This makes movement uniform in the lists, tree, and calendar grids without touching each widget, and a pending **count applies to `hjkl` too** (`3j` now works in a list). Arrow keys themselves are still only intercepted to apply a count (single presses fall through natively). Replaced the old `isMotion` helper.
- In a vertical list `j`/`k` move the selection; `h`/`l` map to the list's horizontal scroll (a no-op when content fits) — the meaningful "move the highlight" is `j`/`k`, matching vim. In the tree/grids all four move.
- Help overlay text corrected: `hjkl` "move the highlight (Enter expands/collapses a tree node)" — the previous "expand/collapse tree nodes" was wrong (Enter does that, not `hjkl`).
- Tests (`keys_test.go`): `j`/`k` move a stand-in overview list (which natively ignores them), and `3j` via the letter alias moves three rows. Full gate + `-race` pass. (Interactive pty verification was flaky in this environment again; the `globalKeys` dispatch is covered directly by the headless tests.)

## 2026-07-08 — Lock item creation to a calendar's type (events vs tasks)

- Owner request: sharpen the fuzzy calendar/task-list split — events only on event calendars, tasks/subtasks only on todo lists, either on a "both" calendar — using the component set now tracked per calendar.
- **Gate** (`internal/ui/calendar.go` `guardComponent`): event creation requires **VEVENT**, task/subtask requires **VTODO**; a wrong-type attempt is refused with an explanatory flash (e.g. *"Errands is a task list — can't add events"*). Wired into `eventCreateContext` (VEVENT) and `taskCreateContext`/`subtaskContext` (VTODO), alongside the existing read-only `guardWrite`. Owner's policy for an **unknown/unconfirmed** component set: **block until known** (declared set required) rather than guessing from contents — so it's refused with "unknown type — sync it first" until a sync settles it.
- **"Both" made explicit** (`componentsForType`): the in-app create form's "Both" now records `["VEVENT","VTODO"]` instead of an empty set, so a both-calendar's type is *known* immediately (empty = unknown under the block-until-known rule). MKCALENDAR still gets both components.
- **Type marker** (`render.go` `calTypeMarker`): the Calendars overview tags each row `[events]`/`[tasks]`/`[both]`, or `[?]` when the component set is unknown — making the gate self-explanatory (and why `[?]` blocks). Sits with the existing `[ro]`/`(hidden)` markers.
- Fixture: gave `personal`'s sidecar `"components": ["VEVENT","VTODO"]` (it holds a standup event + a grocery todo), matching what a real sync would record — so the chord create-task test isn't blocked by an unknown type.
- Tests: `guardComponent` table (event/task/both allowed correctly, unknown blocked both ways), `calTypeMarker` table, `componentsForType("Both")` = explicit set, and the Calendars panel renders `[both]` for personal / `[?]` for work. Full gate + `-race` pass.
- Note: interactive pty capture of this was flaky (tview + pty in this env); verified headlessly instead. Also observed (pre-existing, out of scope) that `j`/`k` don't move the overview *lists* — tview's List binds only arrows — while they do in the task tree.

## 2026-07-08 — Fixes: overview pane titles, empty task lists, visibility-toggle selection

- Three owner-reported bugs from exercising the step-10 finale keymap.
- **Pane titles still showed `1`/`2`/`3`** (`internal/ui/app.go` `build`): the overview boxes were decorated `1 Calendars`/`2 Tasks`/`3 Agenda` from before the remap. Now `c Calendars`/`t Tasks`/`a Agenda`, matching the actual focus keys.
- **Empty task lists were invisible** (`internal/ui/render.go` `buildTasklists`): the panel only listed calendars with `todos > 0`, so a freshly-created (or emptied) task list never appeared — you couldn't add tasks to it. New `supportsTodos` predicate: list a calendar when its supported component set includes **VTODO** (so an empty list shows), falling back to "has todos" when the component set is unknown. To make imported empty lists recognizable, sync now records the server's `supported-calendar-component-set` (already surfaced by go-webdav) via new `store.SetCalendarComponents` (no-op when unchanged), called per calendar in `Sync`.
- **Hiding a calendar jumped the selection to the top** (`internal/ui/keys.go` `afterVisibilityChange`): rebuilding the Calendars list (`Clear`/`AddItem`) parks the cursor at index 0. Now the current row is captured and restored around the rebuild — since hiding marks a calendar rather than removing it, its index is stable, so the cursor stays on the calendar you just toggled.
- Docs: `main.md` task-list description updated (task lists = VTODO-supporting calendars incl. empty).
- Tests: ui — pane titles are `c/t/a`, `supportsTodos` table, an empty in-app VTODO list appears in the Tasks panel, hiding keeps the calendar selection (`bugfix_test.go`); sync — an imported empty VTODO calendar records its component set. Full gate + `-race` pass. Pty: launch renders `c Calendars`/`t Tasks`/`a Agenda`, exit 0, no panic.

## 2026-07-08 — Build step 10 finale (part 12): `:calendar rename|color|hide|show` — step 10 finale complete

- Final finale increment: edit a calendar's server-owned metadata in-app. **Step 10 finale complete** (all seven owner-requested keybinds/commands landed).
- **CalDAV PROPPATCH** (`internal/caldav/proppatch.go`): `SetCalendarProps(path, displayName, color)` issues an RFC 4918 PROPPATCH (DAV:displayname + Apple calendar-color) over the authenticated HTTP client — the same gap-filling approach as MKCALENDAR (go-webdav's client doesn't expose it). Empty values are skipped; success = 207 (or 200).
- **Store** (`internal/store/calendar.go`, sidecar): `UpdateCalendarMeta(id, displayName, color)` edits the local name/color and flags `pending_props` for a server push (offline-first); a still-pending-create calendar just carries the new values into its MKCALENDAR. `PendingCalendarProps` (only calendars already on the server) + `MarkCalendarPropsSynced` drive/clear the push. New `pending_props` sidecar field.
- **Sync** (`internal/sync/sync.go`): `pushCalendarProps` runs before discovery (so a routine pull doesn't race the change) — PROPPATCH each pending calendar, then clear the flag. `Syncer` gained `SetCalendarProps`; `SyncResult.CalendarsUpdated` counts them.
- **UI** (`internal/ui/command.go`): `:calendar rename <name>` / `:calendar color <#rrggbb>` act on the highlighted calendar (guarded read-only), update it locally, and rebuild the lists; `:calendar hide`/`show` mirror the `Space` visibility toggle (shared `afterVisibilityChange`). `normalizeColor` validates the hex. `currentCalendarID` resolves the active panel's calendar.
- Docs: help overlay, `README.md` (command list + PROPPATCH/offline-first note), `CLAUDE.md`. (`main.md`'s `:` section already listed `:calendar`.)
- Tests: caldav — PROPPATCH method/body/error/no-op (`proppatch_test.go`); sync — local rename+recolor pushes one PROPPATCH with the right name/color and doesn't re-push once synced (fake server gained `SetCalendarProps`); ui — `normalizeColor` table, `:calendar rename` updates the local name, `:calendar hide`/`show` toggle visibility. Full gate + `-race` pass. Pty: `:calendar rename Home`, `:calendar color #ff8800`, `:calendar hide` → exit 0, no panic; the sidecar records the new name, color, and `pending_props:true`.

## 2026-07-08 — Build step 10 finale (part 11): `:config` (edit in $EDITOR, reload on exit)

- Sixth finale increment; delivers the settled `:config` convenience (open in `$EDITOR`, reload on exit) deferred out of step 10.
- **UI** (`internal/ui/command.go`): `:config` calls `a.tv.Suspend` (releases the terminal for the editor), runs the `EditConfig` callback, then `applyConfigReload` swaps in a fresh sync closure and flashes — all inside the suspend so it's applied before the redraw on resume. `applyConfigReload` is split out so it's unit-testable without a running app. A nil callback flashes "unavailable".
- **Wiring** keeps the architecture rule intact — the UI runs no editor and parses no config itself. `ui.Options.EditConfig` is provided by `main`: `editConfigFn` (`cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`) launches `$EDITOR` (default `vi`) on the config path, re-reads via `config.Load`, and returns a rebuilt sync closure. It **refuses an account change** (`config.AccountID` differs) with a "restart to switch caches" error, since the vdir cache is account-keyed — a mid-session account swap would point sync at the wrong cache. Added `config.ConfigPath()`.
- Docs: help overlay (`:config` row), `README.md` command list + a note on the account-change caveat, `CLAUDE.md` command list. (`main.md`'s `:` commands section already listed `:config`.)
- Tests (`configreload_test.go`): `:config` with no callback flashes "unavailable"; `applyConfigReload` swaps a non-nil sync closure and flashes "reloaded"; a reload error is surfaced and the sync closure left untouched. Full gate + `-race` pass. Pty (`EDITOR=true`): `:config⏎` suspends, runs the editor, reloads (status shows "reloaded"), exit 0, no panic.

## 2026-07-08 — Build step 10 finale (part 10): yank/paste to move tasks (`y`/`p`)

- Fifth finale increment: move a task (and its subtree) between parents and lists — the reorganize flow that `H`/`L` (one level, in-list) couldn't do.
- **Yank/paste** (`internal/ui/yankpaste.go`): `y` records the selected task (`a.yankUID`); `p` moves it under the current tree selection (or the list's top level when the root is selected). Target list = the selected task list; target parent = the highlighted task. Guards against pasting a task onto itself or into its own subtree (cycle).
  - **Same list** → `reparentTo`: just `SetTodoParent` (RELATED-TO); children follow because their links are UID-based (unchanged).
  - **Different list** → `moveSubtree`: recreate the root + every descendant in the target calendar (`Put` under `ResourceName(uid)`) and delete each from the source, as **one compound undo step** (per resource: delete-the-copy + restore-the-original). The moved root adopts the paste target as its parent; descendants keep their UID links, so the subtree stays intact across the move. Read-only source or target is refused via `guardWrite`.
- Keys `y`/`p` added to `globalKeys` (both freed earlier — `y` was unused, `p` was the retired prev-period). The clipboard clears after a successful move.
- Docs: help overlay, `README.md` (edit prose + key table), `CLAUDE.md` UI line (`main.md` already listed `y`/`p` from the keymap rewrite).
- Tests (`yankpaste_test.go`): same-list paste re-parents Mover under Parent and `u` restores top-level; cross-list `moveSubtree` moves a Mover+Child subtree to another calendar (links intact, root becomes top-level, clipboard cleared) and `u` restores both to the source. Full gate + `-race` pass. Pty: `t y j p u q`, exit 0, no panic.

## 2026-07-08 — Build step 10 finale (part 9): quick field-set (`sp` priority, `sd` due)

- Fourth finale increment: change one field of the selected task without the full edit form.
- **`s` ("set") chord** (`internal/ui/quickfield.go`): `sp` sets priority, `sd` sets/clears the due date — each a one-line `promptInput`. Tasks view only (events have no priority/due); the `s` prefix flashes elsewhere.
- **Field application** honors the property-preservation iron rule: `draftFromTodo` clones the task's current fields into a `TodoDraft`, a mutator changes just the one field, and `EditTodo` re-encodes (so unknown iCal props, VALARMs, RELATED-TO, etc. survive). `applyTodoField` relocates the task fresh, guards read-only calendars, writes, pushes an **undo** step, and refreshes.
- **Parsing** reuses the quick-add rules: `parseSetPriority` accepts `1`-`9` / `high`/`med`/`low` (leading `!` tolerated; blank/`0`/`none` clears); the due prompt runs `ParseQuickAdd` (`fri`, `jul 20`, `3pm`, …; blank clears). Consistent with `it`/`is` quick-add.
- Docs: help overlay, `main.md` keymap (`s` row), `README.md` (edit prose + key table), `CLAUDE.md` UI line.
- Tests (`quickfield_test.go`): `parseSetPriority` table (digits, aliases, clear tokens, out-of-range/garbage rejected); `applyTodoField` sets priority then `u` restores 0; due set (date round-trips) then cleared. Full gate + `-race` pass. Pty: `t sp 3⏎ sd fri⏎ q`, exit 0, no panic.

## 2026-07-08 — Build step 10 finale (part 8): calendar visibility toggle (remembered)

- Third finale increment; closes the visibility toggle promised for the Calendars panel in step 10 but never built.
- **Store** (`internal/store/store.go`): added `EventOccurrencesVisible(from, to, hidden)` and `TodosVisible(hidden)` — the same queries filtered by a set of hidden calendar ids (keyed by id, which the store already has but the old flatten-all queries discarded). `EventOccurrences`/`Todos` now delegate with a nil set, so existing callers are unchanged.
- **State** (`internal/state`): `State` gained `HiddenCalendars []string` (`hidden_calendars`). The `SaveState` callback signature changed to `func(leftWidth int, hidden []string)` and now rewrites the whole state file, so pane width and hidden calendars persist together; `ui.Options` gained `Hidden`. `main.go` loads/saves both.
- **UI**: `a.hidden` (map, seeded from `Options.Hidden`); `persistState` gathers both prefs (sorted for stable output) and calls the save callback — `resizeLeft` now routes through it too. **`Space` in Calendar mode** toggles the highlighted calendar via `toggleCalendarVisibility` (rebuilds the calendar+agenda and persists); in other modes `Space` still toggles task done. The month grid, time-grid, and agenda queries pass `a.hidden`, so a hidden calendar's events **and** due tasks drop out. The Calendars list shows a `(hidden)` marker.
- Docs: help overlay, controls line (adds `Space done/hide` + `/ find`), `main.md` (Space keymap row + Calendars description), `README.md`, and the `CLAUDE.md` UI line updated; the stale "visibility toggles land in step 10" note replaced.
- Tests: `state` round-trip covers `HiddenCalendars`; ui — `toggleCalendarVisibility` hides/shows, persists the id set, and renders the `(hidden)` marker; hiding every calendar yields zero occurrences from `EventOccurrencesVisible`; the sizing test's save stub updated to the new signature. Full gate + `-race` pass. Pty: Calendar mode → `Space` hides the highlighted calendar → exit 0; `state.json` records `hidden_calendars:["personal"]`.

## 2026-07-08 — Build step 10 finale (part 7): incremental search (`/` `n`/`N`)

- Second finale increment: search across the current view.
- **Search** (`internal/ui/search.go`): `/` opens a top-line input; the selection follows the first match **as you type** (incremental — `SetChangedFunc` runs the search on each keystroke, changing only the selection so the input keeps focus). Enter keeps the match (focus lands on the view); Esc cancels and restores the pre-search selection. `n`/`N` cycle matches afterward (matches recomputed each press, so a cycle survives edits). Case-insensitive substring match.
- **Per-mode targets**: Tasks → the task tree (walks every `*model.Todo` node in display order and **expands ancestor folders** to reveal a match inside a collapsed subtree); Agenda → the agenda list; Calendar → the calendars list (search by name). `searchWidget`/`searchItems` centralize the per-mode collection + selection.
- **`:search <text>`** wired into the command dispatcher (also `:find`), matching the `main.md` command list; echoes to the command view.
- Keys: `/` opens search, `n`/`N` next/prev (added to `globalKeys`; `n`/`N` were freed by moving period-nav to `f`/`b`). Help overlay + `:` command hint updated.
- Tests (`search_test.go`): tasks search jumps to the first match and `n` cycles with wrap-around; no-match flashes; `n` with no active query flashes; calendar-name search selects the matching calendar. Full gate + `-race` pass. Pty: drive `t / meet⏎ n N a /g⎋ q`, exit 0, no panic.

## 2026-07-08 — Build step 10 finale (part 6): keymap overhaul + counts / gg-G + fold-all

- Start of a "step 10 finale" (owner-requested extra keybinds, treated as the last UI-polish step before step 11). First increment: a keymap remap that frees the number row, plus vim counts, `gg`/`G`, and tree fold-all.
- **Keymap remap** (owner's mnemonic scheme): panel focus moved off `1`/`2`/`3` to **`c`/`t`/`a`** (Calendars/Tasks/Agenda); the create prefix moved off `a` to **`i`** ("insert" — `it`/`iT`/`ie`/`iE`/`is`/`iS`/`ic`/`il`, Shift = full form), freeing `a` for Agenda and keeping `n`/`N` for search; calendar period nav moved off `n`/`p` to **`f`/`b`** (forward/back). Freeing the digits is what makes counts possible.
- **Vim counts** (`internal/ui/app.go` `globalKeys`): `1`-`9` start a count and `0` extends one (`a.pendingCount`, capped at 999, shown in the status-bar left section); the next motion (`hjkl`/arrows) repeats via `repeatKey`, which feeds the event to the focused primitive N times — reusing tview's own List/TreeView navigation so counted movement matches a single keypress. A non-motion key drops the count.
- **`gg` / `G`** (`internal/ui/keys.go`): `g` is now a which-key prefix — `gg` top, `gt` today, `gd` go-to-date (the old standalone `g`=goto). `gg`/`G` feed `Home`/`End` to the focused list/tree (both handled natively by tview); `<count>G` jumps to the nth item of a list. `G` bottom is a standalone key.
- **Fold-all** (`z` prefix, Tasks view only): `zR` expand-all, `zM` collapse-all, `za` toggle the current node — walks the tree nodes, sets expansion, and keeps each folder's `▸`/`▾` marker in sync.
- **which-key**: the popup footer now varies by prefix (the "Shift = full form" note only shows for the `i` create prefix); `prefixLabel` gains `i`/`g`/`z`.
- Docs: help overlay (`help.go`), controls line (`render.go`), `main.md` keybinding table (rewritten from the stale "draft/future step 10" framing to the real vim-flavored scheme), `README.md` usage + key table, and the `CLAUDE.md` UI line all updated to the new keys.
- Tests (`keys_test.go`): count prefix repeats a motion (`3` then Down moves 3 and resets), `gg`/`G`/`<count>G` land on first/last/nth, fold-all collapses+expands a folder and `za` toggles it; existing chord tests migrated `a`→`i`. Full gate (build/vet/staticcheck) + `go test -race ./...` pass. Pty smoke: TUI drives `t zR zM za gg G 3j c f b [ ] gt a i⎋ q` against a seeded cache, exit 0, no panic.
- Remaining finale increments: search (`/` `n`/`N`), calendar visibility toggle, quick field-set keys, yank/paste (`y`/`p`), `:config`, `:calendar rename|color`.

## 2026-07-07 — Build step 10 (part 5): mouse pass + docs — step 10 complete

- **Mouse** (`internal/ui/mouse.go`): app-level `SetMouseCapture` makes the mouse coherent with the mode model on top of tview's built-in click-to-select/scroll — clicking a left overview panel switches to that mode (so the center follows), and a double-click on the task tree or agenda opens the edit form. Skipped while a modal/overlay is up.
- **Docs**: README rewritten for the chorded keymap (a-prefix create with which-key, contextual `d`, `:` commands, `g`/`?`, `+`/`-`/`Ctrl-arrows`, `:conflicts`, mouse) and the status blockquote marks step 10 complete; CLAUDE.md UI line updated. (Full-cell click mapping for the custom calendar grids and detail-pane accordion collapse noted as future niceties.)
- Test: `TestMouseClickSwitchesMode` draws the layout to a simulation screen so panels have rects, then simulates clicks that switch mode. Full gate + `-race` pass. Pty end-to-end: which-key on `a`, `:view week` echoes to the command view, `?` help opens, `+`/`-` accordion, clean exit.
- **Build step 10 complete.** Next: step 11 (recurrence editing semantics).

## 2026-07-07 — Build step 10 (part 4): interactive pane sizing + state file

- **State file** (`internal/state`): a new package persisting small UI prefs in `<dataDir>/<account-id>/state.json` (0600, atomic rename) — separate from config (never app-written) and the vdir cache. `Load` is best-effort (missing/corrupt → zero, never blocks startup). Wired in `main.go`; `ui` stays disk-free — it receives the remembered width and a `SaveState` callback via a new `ui.Options` (Run's signature is now `Run(Options)`).
- **Keyboard resize** (`Ctrl-←`/`Ctrl-→`): grow/shrink the left overview column by a step, clamped to [16, 50], persisted on each change (`resizeLeft`). Uses `Flex.ResizeItem`.
- **Accordion** (`+`/`-`): `+` collapses the left overview so the Main view fills the width and moves focus into the center; `-` restores it. Switching panels (`1`/`2`/`3`) also restores it. Gated out of Agenda mode (its center navigation is driven by the left agenda list). (Detail-pane collapse left as a future extension; the overview collapse delivers the main width win.)
- Help overlay gained a Layout section.
- Tests: `state` round-trip + bad-file-is-zero; `resizeLeft` clamps at both bounds and calls `SaveState`; accordion is restored on mode switch and blocked in Agenda. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-07 — Build step 10 (part 3): interactive conflict resolution (`:conflicts`)

- Closes the piece deferred from step 9 (sync detects conflicts and keeps both; now they're resolvable in-app).
- **Store** (`internal/store/conflict.go`): `ResolveKeepLocal` clears the conflict and adopts the server's current ETag so the next sync's conditional PUT overwrites the server with the local edit (local .ics untouched). `ResolveKeepServer` decodes the stashed server version and writes it clean via `PutRemote`, so the next sync is a no-op. `writeResource` now also clears a name's conflict stash (any deliberate write supersedes a conflict). Keep-both (preserve both as separate items) noted as a future refinement — needs a new-UID clone; keep-local/keep-server cover winner-picking.
- **UI** (`internal/ui/conflicts.go`): `:conflicts` opens a list of conflicted items (calendar — title); Enter opens a Keep local / Keep server / Cancel chooser; resolving refreshes the views (and the sync-status conflict count) and rebuilds the list, auto-closing when none remain. Added to `:help` and the command dispatcher. The status bar already shows the live conflict count.
- Tests: store — `ResolveKeepLocal` (dirty, adopts server etag, keeps local content, clears conflict, survives reload) and `ResolveKeepServer` (clean, server content adopted). ui — `:conflicts` flashes when none, opens and lists when a conflict is present. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-07 — Build step 10 (part 2): `:` command mode + `?` help overlay

- **Command line** (`internal/ui/command.go`): `:` opens an input near the top; Enter runs, Esc cancels. `runCommand` dispatches `:sync`, `:view month|week|day`, `:goto <date>` (smart-parsed via `ParseQuickAdd`), `:help`, `:q`. Each echoes its command form to the status-bar middle "command view". `g` opens the command line prefilled `goto `. (`:search`/`:config`/`:calendar`/`:conflicts` land in later step-10 increments.)
- **Help overlay** (`internal/ui/help.go`): `?` (and `:help`) open a scrollable cheat sheet grouped by area (panels/nav, create chords, edit, calendar, sync/commands); Esc/`q`/`?` closes, `j`/`k`/arrows scroll. Controls line now advertises `: cmd · ? help`.
- Tests (`command_test.go`): `:view week` switches to calendar/week and echoes; invalid arg flashes without changing state; `:goto 2026-12-25` moves the anchor + switches to calendar; unparseable goto and unknown commands flash; help overlay opens and closes.
- Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-07 — Build step 10 (part 1): chorded keymap + which-key popup

- Start of step 10 (command mode & keybinding polish). First piece: the vim-style chord scheme, replacing the interim standalone create keys.
- **Chord dispatcher** (`internal/ui/keys.go`): `a` is now a prefix — `at`/`aT` task, `ae`/`aE` event, `as`/`aS` subtask (Shift = full form), `ac` calendar, `al` list. `globalKeys` claims the next key when a prefix is pending (before the modal/single-key handling); Esc or an unknown continuation cancels. Bindings live in a `chords` table (data) so the which-key popup and, later, the help screen render from the same source.
- **which-key popup**: after a prefix, a bottom overlay lists the continuations (non-focused — the next keystroke is intercepted by `globalKeys`, so it needs no focus). Chosen per the owner's "shift the object letter" convention.
- **Contextual delete**: `d` deletes the calendar/list when an overview list is focused, else the selected item — folding in the old `D`.
- **Command-view echo**: executing a chord writes its command form to the status bar's middle section (`echo`), the lazygit-style "what you just did" line (fleshed out with `:` command mode next).
- Retired interim keys `A`/`s`/`S`/`c`/`D`; split `addQuick`/`addFull` into typed `addTaskQuick`/`addTaskFull`/`addEventQuick`/`addEventFull`; `createCollection` takes a default-type arg (`ac`→calendar, `al`→list). `r` kept as a `:sync` alias.
- Tests (`keys_test.go`): prefix shows which-key then Esc cancels; `at` completes the chord, opens the quick-add prompt, and echoes the command view; an unknown `az` clears the prefix and flashes. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-07 — Timezone robustness: embed tzdata + Windows-zone map + floating fallback (no more dropped events)

- Follow-up to the read-only fix: another silent-data-loss quirk. go-ical's date parser calls `time.LoadLocation(TZID)` and **errors** on any non-IANA zone (`vendor/.../ical.go:150`); our `ParseEvent`/`ParseTodo` treated that as fatal, so a timed event/todo with an Outlook/Windows TZID (e.g. `Eastern Standard Time`), a custom `VTIMEZONE` label, or *any* TZID on a build without system zoneinfo was rejected and skipped — it silently vanished. Recorded in `main.md` (Timezones decision + step 12).
- **Embed tzdata** (`cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`): blank `import _ "time/tzdata"` bakes the IANA database into the binary, so zones resolve on a minimal Pi image or Windows — fits the "robust single static binary" goal. Verified the binary resolves zones with `ZONEINFO=/nonexistent`.
- **Windows→IANA map** (`internal/model/windowszones.go`): the CLDR windowsZones "001" defaults (~140 entries) map Outlook zone names to IANA.
- **Graceful resolution** (`internal/model/tz.go`, `resolveDateTime`): try go-ical first; on failure map a Windows TZID→IANA; if still unresolved, interpret the value as **floating/local** so the item is kept (at worst offset for an exotic unmapped zone) instead of dropped. Wired into DTSTART, DTEND (recovers an explicit DTEND with a bad TZID; DURATION still handled by go-ical), and DUE.
- Tests: `TestParseEventTimezones` (Windows name → correct IANA offset; real IANA still works; unknown TZID → kept as floating, not dropped); `windowsToIANA` lookups; and a guard that every mapped IANA name actually loads with the embedded db (catches table typos). Full gate + `-race` pass.
- **Owner action**: none required unless you have Outlook-authored events — if any were missing before, they should appear after the next sync.

## 2026-07-07 — Read-only calendars (NextCloud birthdays etc.): detect + block + pull-only

- Owner report: events added to NextCloud's generated "Contact Birthdays" calendar (read-only, no writes allowed in the web UI) were silently discarded during sync. Root cause: LazyPlanner pushed them, the server rejected/dropped them, and reconcile then treated the missing server copy as a remote deletion and `Forget`-ed them. Fix: **know a calendar is read-only and never write to it** (mirrors NextCloud web). Decision recorded in `main.md`. Owner approved discarding the already-stuck test events.
- **Detection** (`internal/caldav/privileges.go`): a Depth-1 `PROPFIND current-user-privilege-set` (RFC 3744) on the calendar home set, issued over our own authed HTTP client (go-webdav's client neither requests nor exposes privileges — same gap as MKCALENDAR). A calendar granting read but not write/write-content/bind/all is read-only. `caldav.Calendar` gained `ReadOnly`, set during `DiscoverCalendars`; a failed privilege query degrades gracefully (fail-open). Plus a **reactive safety net**: `PutObject`/`DeleteObject` map HTTP **403 → `ErrReadOnly`**.
- **Store** (`internal/store`): `Calendar.ReadOnly` + sidecar `read_only` (persists so the UI knows offline) + `SetCalendarReadOnly` (no-op when unchanged).
- **Sync** (`internal/sync/sync.go`): each sync persists the server's read-only status. A read-only calendar is reconciled **pull-only** (`reconcileReadOnly`): local dirty/never-synced resources are discarded, local deletions (tombstones) are reverted by re-pulling, and the server state is mirrored in. If a write ever returns `ErrReadOnly` (privilege detection missed it), the calendar is flagged read-only and the change discarded. New `SyncResult.Discarded` counter.
- **UI** (`internal/ui`): `guardWrite` blocks create/edit/complete/delete/re-parent (and delete-collection) on a read-only calendar with a "read-only" flash — at the source, before opening any form. Read-only calendars/task lists show a `[ro]` marker in the overview lists.
- Tests: caldav — `discoverWritable` parses privilege multistatus (writable vs read-only), 403→`ErrReadOnly`. store — read-only persists across reload. sync — read-only calendar discards a stuck local event and mirrors the server (no writes), reactive-403 marks read-only + discards. ui — `guardWrite` blocks + flashes, `[ro]` marker renders. Full gate + `-race` pass. Pty: read-only calendar blocks `a` (add) with a read-only flash. (Fixed a test-hygiene bug: the read-only UI tests must use the writable temp-copy app harness, not the shared in-place fixture.)
- **Owner action**: confirm against real NextCloud that the birthday calendar is now detected read-only (shows `[ro]`, refuses edits, mirrors birthdays in).

## 2026-07-07 — Build step 9 (part 5): in-app calendar / list creation + deletion (offline-first) — step 9 complete

- Final step-9 piece: create/delete calendars and task lists in-app, offline-first (local now, server round-trip on next sync). **Build step 9 is complete.**
- **Store calendar management** (`internal/store/calendar.go` + sidecar/store): per-calendar pending state in the sidecar (`pending_create`, `pending_delete`, `components`). `CreateCalendarLocal(id, meta, components)` makes the collection locally, flagged for MKCALENDAR. `MarkCalendarDeleted` hides the calendar from `Calendars()` immediately and flags it for a server DELETE (a never-pushed calendar is removed outright, no round-trip). `MarkCalendarSynced`/`RemoveCalendarLocal`/`PendingCalendarDeletes` support the sync push. `Calendars()` skips pending-deletes; the `Calendar` snapshot gained `PendingCreate`/`Components`.
- **Sync** (`internal/sync/sync.go`): before discovery, `pushCalendarDeletes` issues server `DELETE` for calendars marked deleted (then removes them locally; a failed delete stays pending and is not re-imported), and `pushCalendarCreates` issues `MKCALENDAR` (under the calendar-home-set) for locally-created calendars, then records the href so the following reconcile pushes their resources. `Syncer` extended with `CalendarHomeSet`/`CreateCalendar`/`DeleteCalendar` (all already on `*caldav.Client`). New result counters `CalendarsCreated`/`CalendarsDeleted`.
- **UI** (`internal/ui/calendar.go`, `app.go`): **`c`** opens a create form (Name + Type: Event calendar / Task list / Both — defaults to a task list in Tasks mode); **`D`** deletes the highlighted calendar (Calendars) or list (Tasks) with a confirm. Both offline-first. Interim keys (fold into the `a`-prefix `ac`/`al` in step 10); added to the controls line.
- Tests: store calendar API exercised via sync tests; sync — create-local-calendar-then-push-its-resources (MKCALENDAR spec + resources pushed), delete-local-calendar-on-server (DELETE issued, not re-imported), delete-never-pushed-skips-server. UI — `componentsForType`, delete-needs-collection-pane guard. Full gate + `-race` pass. Pty: `c` → typed name → Create writes `<account-id>/calendars/Groceries/` with `pending_create:true` + `components:["VEVENT"]`; exit 0.
- **Owner action**: real-NextCloud MKCALENDAR/DELETE-on-sync acceptance to be confirmed by the owner alongside the sync validation.

## 2026-07-07 — Build step 9 (part 4): in-app sync trigger + sync-status indicator

- Wired the sync engine into the TUI and the status bar.
- **UI sync** (`internal/ui/sync.go`, `app.go`): `Run` now takes a `syncFn` closure (nil = no server → app runs fully offline). `triggerSync` runs the sync on a background goroutine (UI never blocks on the network), coalesces overlapping requests, and on completion `QueueUpdateDraw`s a view refresh + status repaint. **Background sync on startup** fires from `Run` (offline-first: opens instantly from cache, refreshes when sync lands). Interim manual trigger on **`r`** (the real `:sync` command lands with command mode in step 10).
- **Sync-status indicator** (`render.go` `updateStatus` → `renderSyncStatus`): the status bar's right section now shows real state with color+words (TTY-safe, no glyphs): `not configured` (gray) · `syncing...` (yellow) · `synced HH:MM` (green) · `! N conflict(s)` (red, from `store.Conflicts()`) · `offline` (red, on error). Replaced the step-9 placeholder. Controls line gained `r sync`.
- **Wiring** (`cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`): `buildSyncFn` builds a caldav client from `[server]` (resolving `password_command`) and returns the closure; a failing password command or client build is a warning, not fatal — the app opens offline.
- Tests (`internal/ui/sync_test.go`): `renderSyncStatus` across all five states; `syncSummary` (quiet sync → empty, else up/down/conflict); `triggerSync` no-op + hint when unconfigured. Full gate + `-race` pass. Pty smoke: TUI launches, background startup sync against an unreachable server resolves to `offline`, `r` re-triggers, `q` exits 0 — no panic.

## 2026-07-07 — Build step 9 (part 3): two-way sync engine + `lazyplanner sync` CLI

- The must-have feature: ETag-based two-way reconciliation that never silently overwrites.
- **Sync engine** (`internal/sync/sync.go`): `Sync(ctx, Syncer, *store.Store)` reconciles the cache against the server resource by resource, keyed by href + ETag + the local dirty flag. Per-resource decisions: local create (no href) → `PUT If-None-Match:*`; local edit + server unchanged → `PUT If-Match:etag`; server edit + local clean → pull; **both edited → conflict (keep both, flag, no overwrite)**; server-new → pull; server-deleted + local clean → drop locally (`store.Forget`, no tombstone); server-deleted + local edited → conflict (keep local); tombstone → `DELETE If-Match:etag`; tombstone vs server edit (412) → resurrect the server copy + flag. A conflicted resource is skipped on later syncs until resolved. New server calendars are created + pulled; calendars only present locally are left untouched (in-app calendar management handles those). Discovery/listing errors abort; per-resource errors collect in `SyncResult.Skipped`. `Syncer` interface (DiscoverCalendars/DownloadAll/PutObject/DeleteObject) keeps go-ical out of `sync` — pushes go through `model.Parsed.Encode()` → `[]byte`.
- **Store conflict support** (`internal/store/{conflict,sidecar,store,mutate}.go`): `MarkConflict` stashes the server's diverging version losslessly in the sidecar and flags the local resource `Conflicted`; `Conflicts()` lists them (drives the status count → part 4); `Forget` deletes a resource locally without leaving a tombstone (server already lacks it); `remove` also clears any conflict on delete.
- **caldav.PutObject → `[]byte`**: takes the encoded body instead of `*ical.Calendar` so `sync` needs no ical import (architecture rule: go-ical confined to model/caldav).
- **CLI** (`cmd/lazyplanner/sync.go`): `lazyplanner sync` runs a two-way sync against the account-namespaced cache (flags/env creds), printing pushed/pulled/deleted/conflict counts — the runnable path to validate against real NextCloud before the UI drives it.
- Tests (`internal/sync/sync_test.go`): in-memory fake server; one test per branch — push-create (+ idempotent second sync), push-edit, pull-server-edit, pull-new-server-object, conflict-keeps-both (+ skipped next sync), server-delete-drops-clean (no tombstone), server-delete-vs-edit conflict, tombstone push, tombstone-vs-server-edit conflict (resurrect), new-server-calendar. Full gate + `-race` pass.
- **Owner action**: real-NextCloud sync acceptance to be confirmed by the owner (`lazyplanner sync`) — the engine is fake-tested, like the MKCALENDAR work.

## 2026-07-07 — Build step 9 (part 2): sync primitives — delete tombstones + conditional PUT/DELETE

- The store and caldav pieces the two-way engine needs; no sync logic yet.
- **Store tombstones** (`internal/store/{sidecar,store,mutate,tombstone}.go`): deleting a resource that was previously synced (has an `Href`) now records a **tombstone** (href + last ETag) in the sidecar, so sync can push the deletion instead of the resource silently reappearing as "new on server" on the next pull. A never-synced local delete (no Href) leaves no tombstone. `writeResource` clears a name's tombstone whenever it writes that name — so undo's `Restore` resurrecting a just-deleted resource cancels the pending delete for free. New store API: `Tombstones()` (sorted, cross-calendar) and `ClearTombstone` (after a successful server DELETE). Tombstones persist across reload.
- **caldav conditional writes** (`internal/caldav/object.go`): `PutObject(href, cal, ifMatch, create)` — issues the PUT over the authenticated HTTP client (go-webdav's `PutCalendarObject` can't set conditional headers) with `If-Match: <etag>` on update or `If-None-Match: *` on create, so the app never blindly overwrites; returns the new bare ETag. `DeleteObject(href, ifMatch)` — conditional DELETE; 404 is idempotent success. Both map HTTP **412 → `ErrPreconditionFailed`** so sync can turn a lost race into a conflict. ETag representation pinned: the store keeps **bare** ETags (matching go-webdav's unquoting download path) and the header layer quotes/unquotes at the boundary (`normalizeETag`/`httpETag`), so ETags from every code path compare equal.
- Tests: store — synced-delete leaves a tombstone that survives reload and clears; never-synced delete leaves none; `Restore` clears a tombstone. caldav — create sends `If-None-Match: *`; update sends a **quoted** `If-Match` from a bare stored etag and returns the bare new etag; 412 → `ErrPreconditionFailed` (PUT + DELETE); 404 delete is success. Full gate passes.

## 2026-07-07 — Build step 9 (part 1): config module + account-keyed cache path

- Start of two-way sync (step 9). First two sub-parts: the config file and the account-namespaced cache path (both prerequisites — sync needs credentials, and a mismatched cache would corrupt conflict detection).
- **Config module** (`internal/config/config.go`, `template.go`): added `BurntSushi/toml` (vendored). `Config` = `[server]` (url/username/password/**password_command**) + `[appearance]` (first_day_of_week, default_view, time_format, date_format) + `[behavior]` (sync_interval_minutes). `Load()` overlays the file on owner-preferred `Default()`s (a working config needs only `[server]`); a missing file returns `configured=false`. `GenerateDefault()` writes a **fully-commented starter config.toml** (every option at its default, commented) `0600`, never overwriting an existing file. Loose-permission (`&0o077`) files get a non-fatal chmod-600 warning (POSIX-only). `Server.ResolvePassword()` runs `password_command` via `sh -c` (owner's `bw get password lazyplanner`), else inline password — resolved at connect time, not load.
- **Account-keyed cache** (`config.AccountID`, `AccountDataDir`): opaque 12-hex-char sha256 of normalized `url\x00username` (trailing-slash/case-insensitive). Cache root is now `<dataDir>/<account-id>/calendars/…`. Wired into `runTUI` (loads config; on first run writes the starter config and exits so the user fills in `[server]`) and the `import` CLI (same id so import and TUI agree). **No auto-migration** of the old un-namespaced `<dataDir>/calendars/` — the server is source of truth, so a re-import repopulates the new path.
- Tests (`internal/config/config_test.go`): missing→defaults, file-overlay-keeps-omitted-defaults, loose-permission warning, `ResolvePassword` (command precedence + trim, inline fallback), `AccountID` (normalization + distinctness), `GenerateDefault` (parses, 0600, no-overwrite). Full gate (build/vet/staticcheck/test) passes.

## 2026-07-07 — Spec: account model (single-account, server-keyed cache) folded into step 9

- Owner asked to record the account-switching plan before starting step 9. Decision: LazyPlanner stays **single-account** (one `[server]`, no in-app switcher), but account switching — expected rare — **must be safe**, so the local vdir cache is namespaced by a stable `<account-id>` derived from server URL + username (`<dataDir>/<account-id>/calendars/…`). Changing the server connection then maps to a separate cache; two accounts can never share one directory. Rationale: sidecar ETags/hrefs are server-specific, so a mixed cache would corrupt two-way-sync conflict detection.
- Scoped as a **cheap safeguard, not a feature**: full multi-account profiles (`[[account]]` blocks + `:account` switcher) are noted as a future enhancement, explicitly out of initial scope.
- `main.md`: new **Account model** entry in Settled Decisions; **Build Plan step 9** folds in the account-keyed cache path (wired with two-way sync, when a mismatched cache first becomes dangerous).
- Spec-only change (no code). Verified `main.md` reads cleanly and `log.md` heading count matches entry count.

## 2026-07-06 — UI: all-day drill, filled-box completed glyph, full-day time-grid

- Three owner-requested UI changes before step 9.
- **All-day events in the week/day drill cycle** (`timegridview.go`): `dayOccs` now returns the selected day's all-day items first, then timed ones, so `Enter`-to-cycle covers all-day events too. The cycled all-day event is shown highlighted (reverse) in the top band; timed events highlight their block as before. Detail pane follows the selection.
- **Completed-task glyph**: the checkbox now fills with `[■]` when done (was `[x]`) — in the task tree (`nodeLabel`), the month-grid day cells (`itemLabel`), and the agenda list (`agendaLeftLabel`). Hide-by-default behavior is unchanged (glyph only).
- **Week/day fills the height**: the time-grid now scales the full 24-hour day across the pane body (`row = bodyY + hour*bodyH/24`) instead of one fixed row per hour with a scroll window — the day always fills the screen, hour rows grow with the window, and event blocks are sized proportionally. Removed `scrollHour` and the scroll keys (nothing to scroll).
- Tests: `TestTimeGridDrillsAllDayFirst` (all-day cycles before timed), `TestNodeLabelCompletedGlyph` (`[■]`), and `TestTimeGridDrawsDay` now asserts the whole day renders (12am..11pm). Full gate + `-race` pass; pty confirms the day view fills top-to-bottom with the all-day band and a timed block, no panic.

## 2026-07-05 — Fix: legible selection highlight on any theme (reverse video)

- Report: the terminal-background fix made highlighted (selected) text illegible on every tested terminal — a latent bug the black background had masked.
- Cause: tview's default selected style (List `selectedStyle`, TreeNode `selectedTextStyle`) is `Foreground(Styles.PrimitiveBackgroundColor).Background(Styles.PrimaryTextColor)`. With `PrimitiveBackgroundColor` now `ColorDefault`, the selected *foreground* became the terminal's default text color (usually light) on a light bar → unreadable. Previously it was black (the old default), which happened to be legible.
- Fix: select with **reverse video** (`tcell.StyleDefault.Reverse(true)`) for the overview lists (`SetSelectedStyle`) and every task-tree node (`SetSelectedTextStyle`). Reverse is the inverse of the already-legible normal text, so it stays readable on any light or dark scheme and doesn't depend on the palette. The calendar/agenda/time-grid selections were already independent of the primitive background (outline box / explicit fill / reverse) and were unaffected.
- Test: `TestSelectionIsLegible` asserts the highlighted list row renders with the reverse attribute. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-05 — Fix: inherit the terminal background (no more shaded text boxes)

- Report: on some terminal color schemes, text sat in a shaded box (text background ≠ overall background).
- Cause: tview's default `Styles.PrimitiveBackgroundColor` is solid **black**, so every pane/box filled black, while our custom-drawn text (calendar/agenda/time-grid via `printStyled` with `tcell.StyleDefault`) uses the **terminal default** background. On any scheme whose background isn't pure black, the black fill vs. default-bg text cells showed as boxes behind the text.
- Fix: set `tview.Styles.PrimitiveBackgroundColor = tcell.ColorDefault` (in `useTerminalTheme`, folded in with the rounded-border setup and run before any widget is created), so panes, boxes, and text all inherit the terminal's background. Deliberate fills (time-grid event blocks, selection highlights, list selection) still use explicit colors.
- Test: `TestTextInheritsPaneBackground` renders the agenda and asserts a text cell shares the surrounding pane's background (both terminal default). Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-05 — Fix: H/L re-parent now reads the on-screen tree (WYSIWYG)

- Bug: after the folders/sticky-complete work, H/L (indent/outdent) misbehaved — often "can't indent"/"already top level" or nesting under the wrong task.
- Cause: `reparentSelected` recomputed sibling/parent structure with `model.BuildTree(todos, showCompleted)`, but `buildTree` now renders a *different* forest (`BuildTree(visible = incomplete + sticky, true)`). Before folders/sticky both used the same call, so they matched; now they diverge (e.g. the row visually above you is a sticky-completed task the reparent forest omits), so H/L computed the wrong sibling/parent or a no-op.
- Fix (owner chose WYSIWYG): compute parent + previous-sibling directly from the displayed tview tree via `treeNodeContext` (walks `a.tree` for the node's parent + index) — indent nests under the row shown directly above at the same level; outdent moves to the parent's parent (or top level when the parent node is the list root). No second forest, so H/L can't drift from the rendering again. Removed the now-unused `findInForest`.
- Test: `TestReparentUsesOnScreenSibling` indents below a sticky-completed row and asserts it nests under that on-screen row (would fail under the old forest-mismatch logic). Existing reparent test still passes; full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-05 — Popup restyle: terminal-themed forms with a ▸ focus caret

- Owner review of the popups. Reworked the edit/create forms, quick-add line, and confirm dialog to a single look: the terminal's **default (unified) background**, **high-contrast default text**, and an **accent (teal) rounded border/title** — no more white card.
- **Focus caret**: tview reapplies one field style to every form field each frame (and `FormItem` has no `SetLabel`), so a per-field "white when focused" isn't possible. New `caretForm` (`internal/ui/forms.go`) wraps `tview.Form` and, in `Draw`, marks the focused field (`GetFocusedItemIndex`) with a `▸` in a fixed two-column label gutter; the focused button is reversed. Forms now hold explicit field references (`todoFields`/`eventFields`) and read values from them, since the moving caret changes labels and label-lookup would break.
- Removed the old `styleBWForm`/`formText`.
- Tests: `TestCaretFormGutter` exercises the Draw override + gutter (the ▸-on-focus placement needs the live app, verified via pty). Full gate + `-race` pass; pty confirms the edit form shows the caret, labels, title, and Save on a terminal-themed background.

## 2026-07-05 — Fix: sticky-complete worked only on the first task list

- Bug: checking off a task while completed are hidden only kept it visible on the first list; later lists reverted to the old (immediate-hide) behavior.
- Cause: the list-change detection (which drops the sticky pins) lived in `buildTree` and compared `selectedTasklistID()` to `treeListID`. During a panel rebuild, `List.Clear`/`AddItem` park the selection at index 0, and — critically — `List.SetCurrentItem` fires its changed callback *before* updating the current item, so `GetCurrentItem()` was stale (returned the first list). Both made `buildTree` see the first list's id mid-refresh and wipe `stickyDone` for any other list.
- Fix: moved the sticky-clear out of `buildTree` into the tasklist changed-callback, keyed on the callback's **index argument** (reliable) rather than `GetCurrentItem`; suppressed the callback during panel rebuilds (`suspendTree`); and sync `treeListID` when entering tasks mode so restore events aren't misread as a list switch.
- Test: `TestStickyWorksOnNonFirstList` completes a task on a second list and asserts it stays visible. Full gate + `-race` pass.

## 2026-07-05 — UI polish pass (3/3): week/day drill-in, agenda outline box, modal focus

- **Week/day drill-in** (`timegridview.go`): the time-grid now mirrors the month grid — `Enter` on the selected day enters event mode, `↑`/`↓` (`k`/`j`) cycle its timed events with the current one boxed/highlighted and shown in the Detail pane, `Esc`/`←`/`→` back out. New `onSelectEvent` callback + `eventMode`.
- **Agenda outline box** (`agendaboard.go`, new): replaced the agenda center's tview.TextView with a custom-drawn widget that draws a **rounded outline box** around the selected item (matching the calendar's day cursor) instead of a filled bar; items keep their green/aqua colors. It manages its own scroll to keep the selection visible; selection is driven by the left Agenda list.
- **Modal return-focus** (`edit.go`): closing a dialog returns focus to where you were — including a drilled-into calendar day — via a `calGrid` interface (`drillState`/`reDrill`) implemented by both the month and time-grid views, captured on open and restored on close (create/edit refresh first, then restore so the grid can re-drill).
- Tests: time-grid drill-in (Enter → event mode + emit, Esc → exit); agenda selection is outlined (rounded corner drawn, title keeps its color, not inverted). Full gate + `-race` pass; pty smoke test confirms folder arrows, rounded corners, the agenda box, and week drill-in all render with no panics.

## 2026-07-05 — UI polish pass (2/3): create task vs subtask, folders, sticky-complete

- **Create keys** (`edit.go`, `app.go`): split creation into distinct actions — `a` quick-add top-level task (or event in calendar/agenda), `s` quick-add subtask under the highlighted task, `A`/`S` the same via the full form. Refactored the forms into reusable builders (`newTodoForm`/`newEventForm`) + readers (`readTodoDraft`/`readEventDraft`) shared by edit and create; `commitMutation` is the shared write/undo/refresh tail.
- **Folders**: a task with ≥1 incomplete child renders `▸`/`▾` (in place of `[ ]`/`[x]`), the marker flips on expand/collapse; folders can't be completed until their children are (guarded in `toggleComplete`), and revert to a normal task when empty/all-done (`folderSet` recomputed each build). Deleting a task now takes its whole subtree — `descendants` gathers them, the confirm counts them ("Delete X and its N subtask(s)?"), and undo restores them all.
- **Undo** generalized to compound steps (`undoStep.ops []undoOp`) so a recursive delete undoes in one `u`; `pushUndo` helper; all sites migrated.
- **Sticky-complete**: checking off a task while completed are hidden pins it visible (`stickyDone`) until the list is left (switching list or pane), not on a popup/refresh. Fixed a subtle bug where the panel-rebuild's transient empty selection cleared the pins.
- Tests (`edit_test.go`): folder blocks completion until children done then completes; sticky keeps a completed task visible then hides it after leaving the list; `descendants` depth. All pass incl. `-race`.

## 2026-07-05 — UI polish pass (1/3): status bar, cosmetics, tz + Space bugs

- First of a multi-part UI refinement batch (owner feedback). Spec/plan updates + localized fixes + chrome; the behavioral pieces (create-task-vs-subtask, folders, agenda outline widget, week/day drill-in, modal focus restore) land in follow-up commits.
- **Spec/plan** (`main.md`, `CLAUDE.md`): deferred to their proper steps with documentation — in-app **calendar/list creation → step 9** (server MKCALENDAR), **command view + `:` line + full vim-style chorded keymap → step 10**, **sync-status indicator → step 9/12**. Documented (for build now): two-line status bar, create-task vs create-subtask, quick-add/full-form toggle via distinct keys, folder semantics, rounded borders, B/W dialogs, agenda outline box, week/day drill-in, "keep completed visible until leaving list", UTC-store/local-display.
- **Status bar** (`app.go`, `render.go`): the bottom is now two lines — a 3-section bar (left general/results, middle command-view stub → step 10, right sync stub → step 9) above an always-visible controls line. `flash()` writes the left section; it persists until the next `updateStatus`.
- **Cosmetics**: rounded (soft) corners on all borders (`tview.Borders` + custom `drawBox`); monochrome confirm modal and edit forms (white card, black labels, black input boxes). Note: tview applies one field style to every form field per frame, so per-field "white when focused" isn't possible without a custom form; the black boxes on a white card read clearly.
- **Bugs**: timed values are stored UTC but were rendered without converting to local (a created `12:00am` showed as 4am on a UTC-4 box) — all event/occurrence render sites now convert to local. `Space` no longer flashes "select a task" in views where nothing is toggleable (silent no-op). Edit-form fields use `fieldWidth 0` so they fit the dialog instead of overflowing. Shortened the controls line so it doesn't truncate.
- Tests: existing model/store/ui suites pass; pty check confirms rounded corners render, the two-line status bar + sync stub show, and the B/W confirm opens.

## 2026-07-05 — Build step 8: editing (create/edit/complete/delete + undo + re-parent)

- Editing from the UI; writes go to the local vdir only (server push is step 9). Scope confirmed with owner: core create/edit/complete/delete plus session undo (`u`) and indent/outdent re-parent (`H`/`L`).
- **model** (`internal/model/edit.go`, `quickadd.go`): field-mutation + construction helpers honoring the property-preservation iron rule — `EditTodo`/`EditEvent`/`SetTodoCompleted`/`SetTodoParent` clone via encode→decode and mutate the raw component (unknown props, VALARMs survive); `NewTodoObject`/`NewEventObject` build fresh objects (`NewUID`, VERSION/PRODID, DTSTAMP). Timed values stored UTC (Z), all-day date-only. Int props (PRIORITY/PERCENT-COMPLETE/SEQUENCE) written without a VALUE=TEXT tag so they round-trip. Quick-add parser: conservative/documented tokens (dates, times requiring am/pm-or-colon, `!priority`, `#tag`); ambiguity stays in the title; `QuickAdd.At` combines the parsed date/time onto a context day.
- **store** (`internal/store/mutate.go`): `Locate(uid)` finds the resource holding an event/todo; `Restore` writes a prior snapshot back exactly (ETag/Href/Dirty) — the undo primitive. (`Put`/`Delete` already existed from step 4.)
- **ui** (`internal/ui/edit.go`, `app.go`): keys `a` quick-add (contextual), `e` full form (tview.Form modal), `Space` complete-toggle, `d` delete-with-confirm, `u` multi-level session undo (memento of the pre-change snapshot; create→delete, else Restore), `H`/`L` re-parent via RELATED-TO. Top-level `Pages` root hosts centered modal overlays; `globalKeys` yields all keys while a modal is open. New events target the highlighted calendar, new tasks the selected list; a new task nests under the selected tree node. `refresh` rebuilds panels preserving selection and reselects the touched item by UID.
- Tests: model — iron-rule preservation, clone independence, completion round-trip, re-parent preserving other relations, quick-add table. store — Locate, Restore-undoes-edit. ui — create+undo, complete-toggle+undo, indent+undo (headless app harness over a temp copy of the fixture). Full gate + `-race` pass.
- Verified end-to-end via pty against a seeded writable cache: quick-add task modal wrote a file with DUE/PRIORITY:1/NEEDS-ACTION, edit form opened and cancelled, quick-add event wrote DTSTART; exit 0, no panic.

## 2026-07-05 — UI: legible agenda selection + task-tree rooted at list name

- Two owner-noticed polish items.
- **Agenda highlight legibility**: the selected agenda block's title was illegible under tview's region highlight. Root cause: tview derives highlight contrast from a color's *nominal* RGB, but the terminal's 16-color palette remaps those colors, so e.g. a green title became low-contrast under the auto-picked highlight. Fix: stop using tview's region highlight for the agenda; render the selected block ourselves as an explicit **black-on-white** bar (`agendaItemBlock(it, plain)` emits no color tags for the selected block so the uniform wrap wins), and scroll it into view manually (`scrollAgendaTo` — keeps the block visible like a list cursor instead of jumping to top). Non-selected blocks keep their green/aqua colors.
- **Task tree root**: top-level tasks previously dangled from an empty, invisible root node (stems connecting to nothing). The tree root now shows the **list's own name** (teal), so the top-level tasks attach to it like a file tree rooted at its directory.
- Refactor: extracted `newApp(store, title, now)` from `Run` so the UI can be built + loaded headlessly with a fixed clock for tests.
- Files: `internal/ui/{render.go (renderAgenda/scrollAgendaTo/currentAgendaIndex, agendaItemBlock plain mode, buildTree root name), app.go (newApp, drop SetRegions + syncAgendaHighlight, SetChangedFunc→renderAgenda)}`; spec note in `main.md` (task tree rooted at list name).
- Tests: new `internal/ui/app_test.go` — `TestAgendaSelectedBlockLegible` asserts the selected title renders `fg=black,bg=white` on a `SimulationScreen` (guards the contrast fix), `TestTaskTreeRootIsListName` asserts the root text equals the list's display name with children attached. Full gate + `-race` pass; pty smoke test (agenda up/down, tasks) exits 0, no panic.

## 2026-07-05 — UI: focus lives in the overview (calendar + agenda)

- Owner-requested tweak before step 8 (spec updated in `main.md` UI Design + `CLAUDE.md` + `README.md`). Previously `1` and `3` jumped focus straight into the center pane; now all three modes focus their **left overview panel** first (matching how Tasks already worked), so the highlight lives in the overview.
- **Calendars (`1`)** → focus the left Calendars list; arrows highlight each calendar (per-calendar visibility toggles land in step 10). `Enter` dives into the grid (arrows→days, `Enter`→cycle the day's events, `Esc`→back to the list). Added `[` / `]` to cycle the highlighted calendar from anywhere in calendar mode — including while diving in the grid (fast-nav, owner's request). `v`/`n`/`p`/`t` no longer yank focus back to the grid: new `refocusCalendar` keeps focus on the list unless the grid itself was focused (then it follows the swapped month/time primitive).
- **Agenda (`3`)** → focus the left Agenda list; moving its highlight highlights the matching block in the center pane and auto-scrolls to it. Center agenda blocks are now wrapped in tview text regions (`["item-N"]`, `SetRegions(true)`), driven by `syncAgendaHighlight` via the list's `SetChangedFunc`. Detail pane stays hidden (full-width center) as before.
- `Enter`/`Esc` wiring: `calendarView` and `timeGridView` gained an `onExit` callback (Esc in day-mode / time-grid hands focus back to the Calendars list); the month grid's existing two-level Esc (event-mode → day-mode) still works, then a further Esc returns to the list.
- Files: `internal/ui/{app.go (focus model, refocusCalendar/gridFocused/cycleCalendar/syncAgendaHighlight, `[`/`]` keys, agendaCount), render.go (agenda region tags, agendaCount, status hints), calendarview.go (onExit + Esc), timegridview.go (onExit + Esc)}`
- Tests: existing `model` + UI `SimulationScreen` suites pass, incl. `-race`. Smoke-tested the compiled binary through a pty against seeded data (today's `Project meeting` + `Buy groceries` todo): drove `1`→cal nav→`[`/`]`→`Enter`/`Esc` dive→`v v t`→`3` agenda highlight→`2`→`Tab`→`q`; exits 0, no panic, expected labels render.

## 2026-07-04 — UI refinement: center-follows-focus, time-grid, highlight

- Owner-driven UI refinement before step 8 (spec updated in `main.md` UI Design + `CLAUDE.md`). Implements the spec's "Main pane follows focus" properly and adds the requested behaviors. All in one pass.
- **Center follows the active overview panel** (`1`/`2`/`3`), rebuilt around a `mode` + a center `Pages`:
  - **Calendars** → the calendar view (month grid / week·day time-grid). Left Calendars panel lists calendars.
  - **Tasks** → left Tasks panel now lists **only the task lists** (calendars with todos); selecting one opens that list's full subtask tree in the center (inline `[ ]`/`[x]`, `!priority`, `due`), and the Detail pane shows the highlighted task's full fields/description.
  - **Agenda** → center shows the day's events/tasks with **full descriptions at full width**; the Detail pane is **hidden** (`Flex.ResizeItem` to 0) and the view scrolls (PageUp/PageDown).
- **Week/Day = hourly time-grid** (`internal/ui/timegridview.go`, new custom primitive): hour axis, all-day band at top, events drawn as duration-sized blocks, overlapping events placed side-by-side. Overlap layout is a pure, tested `model.LayoutDay` (greedy lane assignment + per-cluster lane count). v1: one row/hour, `scrollHour` window (PgUp/PgDn/arrows scroll), simple overlap — proportional/refined overlap can follow.
- **Highlight fix**: the selected calendar day is now an **outline box** (`drawBox`), not a solid teal fill, so event text stays readable (fixes the "events invisible" complaint).
- **Day → event cycling** (point 5): in the month grid, `Enter` on a selected day enters "event mode" — up/down cycle that day's events and the Detail pane shows the highlighted event/task; `Esc`/left/right exits. (Time-grid event cursor deferred; blocks already show details.)
- Focus/navigation kept interim (finalized in step 10): `1`/`2`/`3` select mode, `Tab` cycles, `Enter`/`Esc` dive into/out of the tree and day-events.
- Files: `internal/ui/{app.go (rewritten: modes, center Pages, detail hide, focus/borders), render.go (rewritten: per-mode build + detail), calendarview.go (outline + event cursor), timegridview.go (new)}`; `internal/model/timegrid.go` (+ test)
- Tests: `model.LayoutDay` (non-overlap, 2-way, 3-way peak) + empty; UI `SimulationScreen` tests — month render, week render, month arrow-select, **time-grid day render** (headers/all-day/hour labels/event block), time-grid arrow. All pass, incl. `-race`
- Verified end-to-end via pty against seeded data: mode 1 shows the calendar + today's event + day detail; mode 2 the Work list's tree ("Write report" → "Draft section") with full task detail; mode 3 the full-width agenda (event location + task description), detail hidden; cycle/nav stress exits 0
- Verification: `gofmt`/`go build`/`go vet`/`staticcheck`/`go test ./...` (+`-race`) all pass
- Deferred/notes: proportional time-grid overlap columns and a time-grid event cursor; the calendar Calendars/Agenda left panels are informational for now (drive nothing) pending the step-10 navigation pass
- Issues: none

---

## 2026-07-04 — Calendar grid: custom spacious primitive (replaces the Table)

- Refinement to step 7's calendar (owner chose the "spacious grid" option). The `tview.Table`-based grid rendered content-width, single-line cells that didn't fill the pane; replaced it with a custom-drawn primitive that fills width and height and lists each day's events/tasks in the cell
- New `internal/ui/calendarview.go` — `calendarView` embeds `*tview.Box` and implements `Draw` + `InputHandler`:
  - Draws weekday headers, a header rule, vertical column separators, and one cell per day; each cell shows the day number then event/task lines (`3pm Title`, `[] Task`), with a `+N more` overflow note and a `N (count)` fallback when the cell is only one line tall
  - Today highlighted (bold), adjacent-month days dimmed, selected day background-filled (brighter when focused); colors from the 16-color palette
  - Arrow / `hjkl` move the selection by ±1 / ±7 days via an `onSelect` callback; the app re-anchors the grid only when the day leaves the visible range (period stays put while navigating within it)
  - `printStyled` helper draws background-aware, width-clipped text (tview's `Print` only sets a foreground color); uses `mattn/go-runewidth` (promoted to a direct dep — already vendored via tcell) for correct truncation
- `app.go`/`render.go`: swapped the Table for `calendarView`; `buildCalendar` now computes each visible day's agenda once (`calItems`) and calls `setData`; removed the Table-era `renderGrid`/`countsFor`/`dayCellLabel`/`onDaySelected`. Left column narrowed to 26 and the calendar given proportion 3 (was 2) so it has more room by default
- Files: `internal/ui/calendarview.go` (+ `calendarview_test.go`), `internal/ui/{app,render}.go`
- Tests added (**headless via tcell `SimulationScreen`** — first real UI unit tests): month render (weekday headers, a day number, an event title all present at 140 cols), week render, and arrow-key selection movement — all pass, including `-race`
- Verification: `gofmt`/`go build`/`go vet`/`staticcheck`/`go test ./...` (+`-race`) pass; `go mod verify` clean; pty smoke exits 0
- Note: at ~80 columns the cells are narrow and titles truncate to day numbers; the grid shows full detail on a wide terminal, and step-10 pane resizing (accordion/keyboard) will let the calendar take the whole screen
- Issues: none

---

## 2026-07-04 — Spec: interactive pane sizing added to step 10

- Owner requested interactive pane resizing; agreed to build it in **step 10** (keybinding polish). Recorded in the spec:
  - `main.md`: new **Pane sizing** subsection under UI Design — (A) **accordion expand** (`+`/`-`, lazygit idiom) collapses side panels/Detail so the Main view fills the screen; (B) **keyboard resize** (`Ctrl-←`/`Ctrl-→`) grows/shrinks left-column & Detail widths via `Flex.ResizeItem`, clamped. Sizes remembered in the state file (not config). Mouse drag-to-resize declared out of scope (keyboard-first). Two keymap rows added; Build Plan step 10 updated
  - `CLAUDE.md`: UI Project Context line notes pane sizing lands in step 10
- Feasibility confirmed in tview: `Flex.ResizeItem` (runtime resize), `Application.SetMouseCapture` + `Box.GetRect` (would enable mouse drag, but that's out of scope). No code yet — spec change only
- Also: terminal-resize reflow already works automatically (tview redraws the Flex tree on resize)

---

## 2026-07-04 — Build step 7: calendar views (month/week/day)

- **Build Plan step 7 complete.** Added the center "Main" pane with month/week/day calendar grids and movement keys, moving to the spec's four-region layout (left panels · calendar · detail · status).
- `model` additions (pure, tested): `MonthGrid(anchor, mondayFirst)` (6×7 days, padded with adjacent-month days, DST-safe midnight arithmetic), `Week`, `StartOfWeek`, `DayStart`, `SameDay`, `OccurrencesOn` (occurrences overlapping a day, multi-day aware)
- `internal/ui`:
  - Layout reworked: left column now stacks **Calendars** / **Tasks tree** / **Agenda**; center **Main** is a `Pages` holding the month/week grid (`tview.Table`) and the day view (`TextView`); **Detail** on the right; status bar
  - Month grid: weekday headers (Monday-first default per spec), one selectable cell per day showing the day number + `*N` event/due-task marker, today highlighted, adjacent-month days dimmed; arrow keys move between days and update Detail with that day's agenda
  - Week view = one-week grid; Day view = that day's agenda text
  - Keys: `v` cycles month→week→day, `n`/`p` prev/next period, `t` today (all global — they only affect the calendar); `1`/`2`/`3` focus left panels, `Tab` cycles all four regions including the calendar; focused pane border highlights
  - Event/due-task counts bucketed across the visible grid range (multi-day events mark every covered day; DTEND treated as exclusive; zero-length events counted on their start day)
- Files: `internal/model/{calendar.go,calendar_test.go}`; `internal/ui/{app.go,render.go}` reworked
- Tests added: `StartOfWeek`, `MonthGrid` (6×7, contiguity, correct padding, covers the month), `OccurrencesOn` (incl. a multi-day span) — all pass. UI is thin glue (no unit tests) but **pty-verified**: month grid renders with Monday-first headers + `*1` marker on today + today's agenda in Detail; week view ("Week of Jun 29, 2026") and day view ("Saturday, Jul 4 2026", "2:00pm Today Meeting") render; a cycle/navigate/tab stress run exits 0 (no crash)
- Verification: `gofmt`/`go build`/`go vet`/`staticcheck`/`go test ./...` all pass
- Note: the task tree moved from center (step 6) back to the left column to give the calendar the Main space; deep-tree ergonomics improve with `>` zoom in a later step. UI remains a v1 draft to refine against real screens
- Issues: none

---

## 2026-07-04 — Calendar creation (MKCALENDAR); resolves the go-webdav gap

- **Resolved the spec's flagged verification** ("verify go-webdav calendar creation"). Finding: go-webdav v0.7.0's CalDAV *client* has no calendar-creation method (only its server code handles MKCOL; `webdav.Client.Mkdir` sends a plain MKCOL = generic collection, not a calendar; the low-level request helpers are in go-webdav's unimportable `internal/` package). Owner opted to verify a fix before proceeding to step 7
- **Fix (no NextCloud web UI needed)**: `caldav.Client` now retains the authenticated HTTP client + parsed endpoint, so it can issue verbs go-webdav doesn't expose. Added:
  - `CreateCalendar(ctx, path, CalendarSpec)` — RFC 4791 **MKCALENDAR** with displayname, description, Apple `calendar-color`, and `supported-calendar-component-set` (VEVENT / VTODO / both). Generated XML eyeball-checked for correct namespaces; success = 201, errors surface the server's response body
  - `DeleteCalendar(ctx, path)` — DELETE on the collection (so calendars can be removed in-app too)
  - `CalendarHomeSet(ctx)` — extracted from DiscoverCalendars (principal → home set), reused by create
- **CLI**: new `lazyplanner calendar <list|create|delete>` subcommand (`create` flags: `--name`, `--tasks`, `--both`, `--color`, `--desc`, `--path`; slugifies the name into the collection path under the home set). `main.go` dispatch tidied (`exitOnError`); shared `connFlags` helper extracted and `import` refactored onto it
- Files: `internal/caldav/{client.go (endpoint/http fields, CalendarHomeSet),mkcalendar.go}`; `cmd/lazyplanner/{calendar.go,conn.go}`, `import.go`/`main.go` updated; tests `internal/caldav/mkcalendar_test.go`; README documents the new commands
- Tests added: `CreateCalendar` (method=MKCALENDAR, path, body contains displayname/color/comp set), default-components (VEVENT+VTODO), error surfacing (non-201 includes server hint), `DeleteCalendar` (method=DELETE) — all pass via httptest
- Verification: `gofmt`/`go build`/`go vet`/`staticcheck`/`go test ./...` all pass. **Real-server MKCALENDAR acceptance to be confirmed by the owner** against their NextCloud (`lazyplanner calendar create`) before relying on it
- Memory: recorded the decision + plan ([[calendar-creation-mkcalendar]])

---

## 2026-07-04 — Build step 6: read-only UI shell

- **Build Plan step 6 complete.** First real tview UI: a read-only shell over the imported cache, showing a subtask tree and a day agenda. `lazyplanner` (no args) now opens it.
- **Decomposition**: the testable logic lives in `model` (pure, unit-tested); `internal/ui` is thin tview glue verified by launch. Only `ui` imports tview/tcell (architecture rule holds)
- `model` additions (tested):
  - `BuildTree(todos, includeCompleted)` → `[]*TodoNode` — assembles the subtask forest from `ParentUID`, smart-sorts siblings, hides completed by default (their incomplete descendants surface as roots), and **breaks cycles** in malformed data (guarded against infinite recursion)
  - `SortTodos` — smart sort: due (soonest, undated last) → priority (1 highest, 0/undefined last) → title
  - `DayAgenda(occs, todos, dayStart, dayEnd)` → `[]AgendaItem` — merges event occurrences with todos due that day, all-day first then by time
- `internal/ui` (`app.go` + `render.go`): three-pane read-only shell —
  - **Left column**: Calendars list + Agenda list; **center**: the Tasks tree (centerpiece, given the width) with each calendar as a top-level folder; **right**: Detail pane; **bottom**: status bar with key hints + live counts + load-error indicator
  - Focus with `1`/`2`/`3` and `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` (focused pane border turns yellow); Detail tracks the focused pane's selection; `Enter`/`Space` expand/collapse tasks; `.` toggles completed; `q`/`Ctrl-C` quit; mouse enabled
  - Colors use the terminal 16-color palette (per spec); labels use ASCII markers (`[ ]`/`[x]`) to render on a bare TTY
- Wiring: `ui.Run` now takes `*store.Store`; `cmd/lazyplanner` `runTUI` opens the cache at `config.DataDir()` and hands it to the UI (UI reads only through the store)
- Files: `internal/model/{tree,agenda}.go` + tests; `internal/ui/{app,render}.go` (replaced the placeholder); `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go` updated; README Usage documents the TUI + current keymap
- Tests added: `BuildTree` (hierarchy, hide/show completed, cycle-breaking), `SortTodos`, `DayAgenda` — all pass. UI is thin glue (no unit tests) but **launch-verified** via pty: renders panes + calendar/tree/agenda from a populated cache and quits 0; empty cache shows the welcome/"nothing today" and quits 0; no-TTY still errors gracefully (exit 1, no panic)
- Verification: `gofmt`/`go build`/`go vet`/`staticcheck`/`go test ./...` all pass
- Scope note: the big "Main" pane + month/week/day calendar grids are step 7; this step is the shell + task tree + agenda
- Issues: none

---

## 2026-07-04 — Build step 5: CalDAV one-way import

- **Build Plan step 5 complete.** LazyPlanner can now connect to NextCloud, discover calendars, and download everything into the local vdir — a one-way pull, done before the UI so the model is validated against real server data early. First code that talks to a real server.
- Added and vendored `github.com/emersion/go-webdav` v0.7.0 (go-vcard correctly pruned as unused; MVS keeps the newer go-ical across the module)
- `internal/caldav` — the only package that speaks HTTP. `Client` wraps go-webdav:
  - `NewClient(Config)` — basic-auth (app password) over `webdav.HTTPClientWithBasicAuth`; injectable `*http.Client` for tests; default 30s timeout
  - `DiscoverCalendars(ctx)` — walks current-user-principal → calendar-home-set → calendars
  - `DownloadAll(ctx, path)` — one calendar-query REPORT returning full data + ETags for every resource
  - Types `Calendar` and `Object{Path, ETag, Data *ical.Calendar}`; go-ical stays confined to model/caldav
- `internal/sync` — seeded with the orchestration layer (imports caldav + store + model, the higher tier):
  - `Import(ctx, Source, *store.Store)` — discovers calendars, sets metadata, downloads and upserts every resource as clean/synced. **Pull-only** (no local-change push, no deletion of server-absent locals — that's the two-way sync step). Unparseable/unwritable resources are **skipped and collected**; only discovery/listing failures abort
  - `Source` interface (satisfied by `*caldav.Client`) makes the import unit-testable with a fake
- `internal/store` additions: `PutRemote` (writes a resource clean — not dirty, with server ETag/href), `SetCalendarMeta`, `SetSyncToken`; refactored `Put`/`PutRemote` onto a shared `writeResource`; exported `SafeName`
- `internal/model`: added `Parse(*ical.Calendar, loc)` (Decode now = decode-bytes + Parse) so the sync layer can consume go-webdav's already-decoded calendars
- `internal/config`: added the OS-aware path helpers `DataDir()` / `ConfigDir()` (XDG on Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%`/`%APPDATA%` on Windows, `Application Support` on macOS) — needed for a default data location
- **Runnable now**: `lazyplanner import` subcommand (thin wiring in `cmd/lazyplanner`) reads `--url/--username/--password` or `LAZYPLANNER_CALDAV_*` env vars, uses a NextCloud app password, cancels cleanly on Ctrl-C, and prints a summary. README documents it. The owner can validate against real NextCloud immediately
- Files: `internal/caldav/client.go`, `internal/sync/import.go`, `internal/store/remote.go`, `internal/config/paths.go`, `cmd/lazyplanner/import.go`; tests `internal/caldav/client_test.go` (httptest canned multistatus), `internal/sync/import_test.go` (fake source), `internal/store/remote_test.go`
- Tests added: `DownloadAll` against a canned CalDAV REPORT (validated the real query→parse path — and surfaced that go-webdav unquotes ETags via `strconv.Unquote`, so the store holds unquoted etags); `Import` (2 calendars, skips a bad resource, clean state persisted across reload); import discovery-error; `PutRemote`/`SetCalendarMeta` round-trip. All pass, including `-race`
- Verification: `gofmt`/`go build`/`go vet`/`staticcheck`/`go test ./...` (+`-race`) all pass; `go mod verify` clean; `lazyplanner import` with no creds returns a clean error (exit 1)
- Not yet handled (noted for later steps): calendar color (go-webdav's FindCalendars doesn't surface it), pruning of server-absent local resources, and pushing local edits — all part of two-way sync (step 9)
- Issues: none

---

## 2026-07-04 — Build step 4: vdir store

- **Build Plan step 4 complete.** `internal/store` is the local vdir cache — the first package with filesystem I/O. Reads a vdir tree into an in-memory index, writes resources back atomically, and persists sync state in a per-calendar JSON sidecar. Concurrency-safe (RWMutex; passes `go test -race`) since background sync will mutate it while the UI reads.
- Layout: `<dataDir>/calendars/<calendar-id>/<name>.ics` (one file per event/todo object, the local source of truth) + `.lazyplanner.json` sidecar per calendar (server-owned display name/color, sync token, href, and per-resource ETag/href/dirty). The `.ics` files win: sidecar is derived data, rebuilt on sync if lost/corrupt
- Types (all snapshots immutable; resources replaced copy-on-write, never mutated in place): `Store`, `Calendar` (metadata + `[]*Resource`), `Resource` (Name, ETag, Href, Dirty, parsed `*model.Parsed`), `LoadError`
- API:
  - `Open(ctx, dataDir)` — scans calendars, parses each `.ics`, merges sidecar sync state; missing dir → empty store (first run); unparseable/unreadable files are **skipped and recorded** in `LoadErrors()` (a corrupt file never blocks startup)
  - `Calendars()`, `Calendar(id)` — sorted snapshots; DisplayName falls back to id
  - `Todos()`, `EventOccurrences(from, to)` — the in-memory index backing task and calendar-view queries (occurrences via the step-3 recurrence engine, sorted)
  - `Put(ctx, calID, name, obj)` — atomic write-temp-fsync-rename (+ dir fsync), creates the calendar dir on first write, marks the resource `Dirty`, **preserves server identity (ETag/Href) on overwrite** so sync can detect local edits; updates index + sidecar
  - `Delete(ctx, calID, name)` — local delete (server propagation is the sync layer's job)
  - `ResourceName(uid)` — filesystem-safe `.ics` name for new resources
- `model`: added `(*Parsed).Encode()` (symmetric with `Decode`), keeping go-ical confined to `model`; the store round-trips resources through it, so unknown properties are preserved on write (verified by test — an `X-` property survives Put)
- Design decisions: I/O entry points take `context.Context` (checked for cancellation) per the no-uninterruptible-blocking rule; data files `0600` / dirs `0700` (private by default); filename keyed by sanitized UID for new resources, but existing resources keep their on-disk name so they map back to the same server resource
- Files: `internal/store/{store,mutate,sidecar}.go`; tests `internal/store/store_test.go` with a committed fixture vdir tree under `testdata/vdir/` (two calendars, a todo, an untracked file, a corrupt file) plus `t.TempDir()` round-trip tests
- Tests added: load tree (metadata, tracked/untracked ETags, sidecar fallback, load-error surfacing), queries, missing-dir, Put+reload+preservation, server-identity preservation on overwrite, Delete (+reload), cancelled-context — all pass, including `-race`
- Verification: `gofmt`/`go build`/`go vet`/`staticcheck`/`go test ./...` (and `-race`) all pass; `go mod verify` clean (no new deps)
- Issues: none

---

## 2026-07-04 — Build step 3: recurrence expansion

- **Build Plan step 3 complete.** `internal/model` now expands recurring events into concrete occurrences over a date window, wrapping `teambition/rrule-go` behind a small model API. Timezone-aware and heavily tested (recurrence is a classic bug farm).
- `rrule-go` promoted from indirect to a direct dependency; re-vendored (`go mod verify` clean)
- API (`internal/model/recurrence.go`):
  - `Occurrence{Start, End, Event}` — one materialized instance; `Event` points to the underlying component so the UI can show details and route edits
  - `(*Event).Occurrences(from, to)` — expands a single component's RRULE + RDATE − EXDATE within the half-open window `[from, to)`, anchored at DTSTART; non-recurring events yield at most one instance. Queries start one duration early so an instance that begins before the window but overlaps it is still returned
  - `(*Parsed).EventOccurrences(from, to)` — object-level expansion that applies **RECURRENCE-ID overrides**: an override replaces the instance it targets (moved time / changed details) and the original slot is suppressed; orphan overrides stand alone. Results sorted by start
  - `(*Event).Duration()` helper
- Correctness decisions, grounded by probing rrule-go's actual behavior first (then the probe was removed):
  - **DST**: instances keep wall-clock time across transitions (weekly 09:00 stays 09:00 local; the UTC instant shifts an hour). Verified explicitly in a spring-forward test
  - **DTSTART inclusion**: rrule-go emits DTSTART only via an RRULE, so for RDATE-only events DTSTART is added explicitly (it belongs to the recurrence set per RFC 5545)
  - **Must set `ROption.Dtstart`** before building the rule — rrule-go otherwise defaults it to "now"
  - **UNTIL** boundary is inclusive; **EXDATE** must match the instance instant (incl. TZID); all handled
  - **Not yet handled**: `RANGE=THISANDFUTURE` on an override (affects only its own instance for now — noted for the recurrence-editing step); recurring *todos* (deferred — their occurrence semantics tie to completion)
- Files: `internal/model/recurrence.go`; tests `internal/model/recurrence_test.go` with five new fixtures (`recur_weekly_dst`, `recur_exdate`, `recur_allday`, `recur_rdate`, `recur_override`)
- Tests added: weekly-DST, EXDATE, all-day recurring, RDATE-only, windowing (narrow / empty), non-recurring multi-day overlap, and RECURRENCE-ID override — all pass
- Verification: `gofmt`/`go build`/`go vet`/`staticcheck`/`go test ./...` all pass; `go mod verify` clean
- Issues: none

---

## 2026-07-04 — Build step 2: core model (iCalendar parsing)

- **Build Plan step 2 complete.** `internal/model` now parses events and todos from iCalendar data via `emersion/go-ical`. Pure logic, no filesystem/network I/O — fully headless.
- Added and vendored `github.com/emersion/go-ical` (pulls `teambition/rrule-go` as an indirect dep, ready for the recurrence step)
- Types: `Event` (UID, Summary, Start/End, AllDay, Location, Description, HasAlarm, Recurring) and `Todo` (UID, Summary, Due/HasDue/DueAllDay, Status, Priority, Categories, Description, ParentUID, Recurring, `Completed()`); `TodoStatus` enum + `PriorityUndefined`
- Parsers: `ParseEvent`/`ParseTodo` (per-component units) and `Decode` (whole-stream convenience). Design choices honoring the spec:
  - **Property-preservation iron rule**: each type keeps its source `*ical.Component` as `Raw`, and `Parsed.Calendar` retains the whole decoded calendar, so unknown properties/components survive a future re-encode. A decode→encode round-trip test proves an `X-` property and a `VALARM` are preserved
  - **All-day detection** via `VALUE=DATE` (with a bare-`YYYYMMDD` fallback); all-day/date-only values interpreted at local midnight
  - **Timezones**: TZID and UTC (`Z`) instants parsed correctly; floating times interpreted in a caller-supplied `loc` (defaults to `time.Local` per the local-timezone rule)
  - **Subtask hierarchy**: `ParentUID` from `RELATED-TO`, treating absent-or-`RELTYPE=PARENT` as the parent per RFC 5545 (matches NextCloud Tasks)
  - **Graceful degradation**: a malformed *required* field (event DTSTART) errors; malformed *optional* fields degrade to zero values rather than discarding the item. `Decode` fails on the first bad component; per-item resilience is left to the store layer (step 4)
  - **Reminder indicator**: `HasAlarm` reflects VALARM presence only — LazyPlanner never fires notifications
- Files: `internal/model/{decode,event,todo}.go`; tests `internal/model/model_test.go` (table-driven, `package model_test` against the public API) with six `testdata/*.ics` fixtures (timed/all-day/UTC-recurring events; timed-due/completed-subtask/minimal todos)
- Tests added: `TestParseEvents`, `TestParseTodos`, `TestRoundTripPreservesUnknownData`, `TestDecodeMalformedStreamErrors` — all pass (8 subtests, no skips; timezone DB present)
- Verification: `gofmt -l` clean; `go build`/`go vet`/`staticcheck`/`go test ./...` all pass
- Issues: none

---

## 2026-07-04 — Build step 1: project scaffold

- **Build Plan step 1 complete.** First code in the repo; toolchain proven end to end (build, vet, staticcheck, test, and a launchable tview window).
- `go mod init github.com/littekge/LazyPlanner` (Go 1.26.4). Added and **vendored** the UI deps: `rivo/tview` v0.42.0 + `gdamore/tcell/v2` v2.13.10 (with transitive deps); `go mod tidy && go mod vendor`, `vendor/` committed
- Package skeleton created per the `main.md` architecture: `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go` (thin wiring — app identity + hand-off to UI) and `internal/{config,model,store,caldav,sync,ui}`. The not-yet-implemented packages carry a `doc.go` with the package doc comment stating each one's responsibility and separation rule
- `internal/ui/app.go`: `Run(title)` builds a tview Application showing a centered placeholder window; quits cleanly on `q` (explicit) and `Ctrl-C` (tview default); mouse enabled. Only `ui` imports tview/tcell, per the architecture rules
- `.gitignore` (build output, go.work, coverage, editor/OS cruft; `vendor/` deliberately **not** ignored)
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — GitHub Actions running `go build`/`go test`/`go vet` + `dominikh/staticcheck-action` on push and PR, using `go-version-file: go.mod`
- Files created: `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `vendor/**`, `cmd/lazyplanner/main.go`, `internal/{config,model,store,caldav,sync}/doc.go`, `internal/ui/app.go`, `.gitignore`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. `README.md` updated (status → scaffolding; real build/run instructions)
- Verification: `gofmt -l` clean; `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...` all pass; `go test ./...` passes (no test files yet — thin UI glue and empty stubs; real tests begin at step 2). Manually confirmed the TUI: renders `LazyPlanner 0.0.1` and exits 0 on `q` in a pty; exits 1 with a wrapped error (no panic) when no TTY is available
- Issues: none. `go get` auto-upgraded tcell to v2.13.10 (from an initial v2.8.1 resolution) and pulled newer `golang.org/x` deps — expected, all vendored

---

## 2026-07-04 — Log repair: restored per-entry headings; format rule hardened

- Fixed `log.md`: 14 of 15 entries had lost their `## YYYY-MM-DD — Title` headings (an insert-at-top editing mistake repeatedly consumed the previous entry's heading), leaving anonymous `---`-separated blocks. All headings restored from session history; content unchanged
- `CLAUDE.md` Log Format section hardened: every entry gets its own heading (even same-day/same-session), never append under an existing heading, inserts must leave the previous entry byte-identical, and verify heading-count == entry-count after editing

---

## 2026-07-04 — Git branching rules for the build

- `CLAUDE.md`: new Git Branching Rules section — all Claude work happens on **`ai-workspace`** (or branches off it, merged back into it); **never merge or commit to `main`** (owner-only, after review); **`ai-init`** is a frozen branch preserving the pre-build-step-1 state (spec complete, no code) as a permanent reference/reset point
- Workflow commit step updated to name the branch
- Branches created: `ai-init` (frozen at this commit) and `ai-workspace` (checked out, ready for build step 1)

---

## 2026-07-04 — Final pre-build pass: handoff readiness audit

- Audited all spec files with fresh eyes ahead of a new build session; fixed staleness that would mislead a fresh reader:
  - `main.md` header status ("early skeleton" → "spec complete and code-ready, begin at Build Plan step 1"), Current State updated, leftover "TBD — more goals" design-goal bullet replaced with the well-behaved-CalDAV-citizen goal
  - `CLAUDE.md`: removed stale "will be expanded once language decided" note, fixed run command for the cmd/ layout (`go run ./cmd/lazyplanner`), added staticcheck install command (dev tool, not vendored), "config format TBD" → TOML
- Final decisions closed:
  - **License: MIT confirmed** — `LICENSE` (MIT, Gabriel Litteken) already existed from the initial commit and matches
  - **examples/ committed** — reference specs kept in the repo
  - **README.md is a living document**: what the program does, usage docs, build/install for Linux + Windows; updated in the same increment as any user-visible change. Rule added to CLAUDE.md workflow (step 6); starter README written (pre-build status, planned sections stubbed)
  - **CI: deferred to scaffold** — GitHub Actions (test/vet/staticcheck) added to Build Plan step 1, alongside `.gitignore`
- Spec is handoff-ready for the build session

---

## 2026-07-04 — UI follow-up decisions: colors, completed tasks, sorting, undo

- **Colors**: terminal 16-color palette (inherits terminal theme, works on TTY/Pi); server calendar colors mapped to nearest palette color. Truecolor theme rejected
- **Completed tasks**: hidden by default, `.` toggles struck-through display (dotfiles gesture)
- **Sibling task sort**: smart sort — due date, then priority, then title; manual ordering rejected (no standard iCal order field; wouldn't survive other clients)
- **Undo**: session-scoped undo stack (`u`) — every local mutation pushes the prior .ics version onto an in-memory stack; persistent trash deferred
- `main.md`: new subsection under UI Design; `u` and `.` added to keymap. `CLAUDE.md` UI line updated
- Remaining UI details (pane proportions, cell rendering, truncation) deliberately deferred to build steps 6–8 against real screens

---

## 2026-07-04 — UI design v1 draft: spec is code-ready

- **Layout**: lazygit-style three regions — left column of focusable panels (1 Calendars, 2 Tasks tree, 3 Agenda), Main pane whose content follows focus (calendar grid / zoomed task tree / day agenda), always-visible right Detail pane (owner requested event detail next to calendar), status bar with contextual hints + sync state. Chosen over "two workspaces" and "dashboard" alternatives
- **Task tree navigation**: full collapsible tree + `>`/`<` zoom (re-root at selected task, breadcrumb, like cd-ing into a directory). Chosen over ranger-style drill-in and plain tree
- **Creation UX**: `a` quick-add one-liner with smart parsing (dates, times, `!priority`, `#tag`; unparsed text → title; predictable rules documented in `:help`), `e` full form. Chosen over title-only quick-add and form-always
- Draft keybinding table and `:` command set written into `main.md` (hardcoded v1; `[keys]` config section deferred)
- Open Decisions section now empty — **spec is code-ready**; UI marked as v1 draft to refine against real screens during build steps 6–8. Non-blocking loose ends: confirm MIT, verify go-webdav calendar creation
- `CLAUDE.md`: UI summary line added to Project Context

---

## 2026-07-04 — Data model: fields, subtask hierarchy, preservation rule, recurrence scopes

- **Task fields surfaced**: title, due, status, priority (iCal 1–9), tags (CATEGORIES), notes, subtasks. **Subtasks are the owner's centerpiece feature** — arbitrary-depth nesting via RELATED-TO (RELTYPE=PARENT, same as NextCloud Tasks so existing data imports as-is), UI presents the tree like a file explorer; "folders" are just tasks with children
- **Event fields surfaced**: title, start/end, all-day, recurrence, location, notes, reminder indicator (LazyPlanner shows alarms exist but never fires notifications — phone/NextCloud handle that)
- **Property preservation iron rule**: never drop/mangle unrecognized iCal properties; edits to known fields preserve everything else. Added to CLAUDE.md as a hard rule
- **Timezones**: store server's data, display/create in system local timezone, all-day items date-only
- **Recurrence editing**: all three scopes (only-this via RECURRENCE-ID, this-and-future via series split, all via master edit)
- `main.md`: core features bullet rewritten around the subtask tree; six data-model entries added to Settled Decisions; Open Decisions down to UI design only
- Also: committed the spec files (d9cc198) — examples/ left untracked pending owner preference

---

## 2026-07-04 — Sync design: credentials, conflict resolution, triggers

- **Credentials**: NextCloud app password only (never the real password), stored in `config.toml` with enforced-0600 warning; optional `password_command` escape hatch (owner runs Vaultwarden, so `bw get password lazyplanner` works — Vaultwarden speaks the Bitwarden API). OS keyring rejected (daemon breaks headless Pi, extra dep + failure modes)
- **Conflicts**: ETag-based detection with conditional writes — never silently overwrite either direction; true conflicts keep both versions, flag the item, and surface a UI indicator for resolution at leisure (pick winner or keep both). "Newest wins" / "server wins" rejected as silent data-loss paths
- **Triggers**: manual `:sync` + all three automatic: background sync on startup (open instantly from cache), periodic while open (default 15 min, 0 = off), debounced push a few seconds after local edits
- `main.md`: three sync decisions added to Settled Decisions; Open Decisions down to data model details + UI design
- `CLAUDE.md`: sync summary line added to Project Context

## 2026-07-04 — Default config values set to owner's preferences

- Principle recorded in `main.md`: all moderate-scope options stay configurable in the config file; the *default value* of each option (when unset) is the owner's preference, so a working config needs only the `[server]` section (the one unavoidable first-run edit). Initially phrased as "hardcoded defaults" — corrected after owner feedback: reducing needed edits must not reduce config capability
- Defaults chosen: week starts Monday, 12-hour time display (2:30pm), month view on open, US date format (07/04/2026), sync all calendars with server names/colors

---

## 2026-07-04 — Config editing model; calendar metadata is server-owned

- **Config editing**: hand-edit + read-once-at-startup; the app never writes the config file. Planned conveniences: first-run generation of a fully-commented default config, and a `:config` command (open in `$EDITOR`, reload on exit). Auto-reload/file-watching explicitly rejected. App-remembered state (e.g., last view) goes in a state file under the data dir, not config.
- **Calendar metadata**: resolved the apparent conflict between "app never writes config" and "rename/recolor/create calendars in-app" — calendar identity, display name, and color are CalDAV properties owned by the server (cached in the vdir via sidecar convention), so in-app changes go through sync, not the config file, and propagate to NextCloud web/other clients. Config `[[calendars]]` sections demoted to optional local overrides (hide locally, override color locally); default is sync-everything with server names/colors. New calendars: CalDAV make-calendar call, with create-in-NextCloud-web as fallback if go-webdav lacks client support (verify at build time).
- `main.md`: config settled-decision entry updated (overrides, not definitions); two new settled decisions added (config editing model, server-owned calendar metadata)
- `CLAUDE.md`: config context line updated with the never-writes-config rule

## 2026-07-04 — Config decision: TOML, moderate scope; runtime paths; Windows as secondary target

- **Config file**: TOML via `BurntSushi/toml`, moderate scope — server connection, calendar selection/colors/visibility, appearance/behavior options (first day of week, default view, date/time formats, sync interval). Keybindings hardcoded for now; schema leaves room for a future `[keys]` section. Rejected: INI (no standard spec), YAML (footgun spec + heavy dep), JSON (no comments)
- **Platform scope**: Linux is primary (features tailored to it); Windows is a secondary compatibility build. All path resolution through one OS-aware helper (`os.UserConfigDir` + data-dir helper)
- **Runtime file locations** documented in `main.md`: config at `~/.config/lazyplanner/config.toml`, calendar data at `~/.local/share/lazyplanner/calendars/` (XDG data, NOT ~/.cache — offline edits live there, never disposable); Windows equivalents `%APPDATA%` / `%LOCALAPPDATA%`
- `main.md`: platform line updated, BurntSushi/toml added to libraries, config decision in Settled Decisions, Runtime File Locations section added under Architecture, Open Decisions now: sync details → data model → UI design
- `CLAUDE.md`: config + runtime paths line added to Project Context

---

## 2026-07-04 — Drafted: architecture, build plan, housekeeping

- `main.md` Architecture section: idiomatic Go layout (`cmd/lazyplanner/` entry point, `internal/{config,model,store,caldav,sync,ui}`, committed `vendor/`, tests beside code with `testdata/` fixtures) with separation rules — only `ui` imports tview; `model` does no I/O; `store` owns the cache dir; `caldav` owns HTTP. Note added explaining why Go doesn't use src/lib/include/test dirs.
- `main.md` Build Plan: 13 incremental steps — scaffold → model → recurrence → vdir store → CalDAV one-way import (early, to validate against real NextCloud data) → read-only UI shell → calendar views → editing → two-way sync (completes the must-have) → command mode → recurrence editing → background sync → Raspberry Pi target
- `main.md` housekeeping: module path `github.com/littekge/LazyPlanner` (matches GitHub remote), Go minimum = stable at scaffold time bumped only deliberately, license MIT (proposed, pending confirmation)
- `CLAUDE.md` Architecture Rules section filled in with the hard separation rules + "code is hand-edited by the user; keep it conventional and boring"
- Open Decisions reordered: config file (in discussion) → sync details → data model → UI design

## 2026-07-04 — Cache storage decision: vdir-style raw .ics files

- Chose **vdir-style raw `.ics` files** for the offline-first local cache: one file per event/todo, one directory per calendar (vdirsyncer/khal convention), JSON sidecar for sync state (ETags, sync tokens), in-memory index built at startup
- Reasons: 1:1 mapping onto CalDAV resources keeps sync logic simple, zero extra dependencies (pure Go, easy Pi cross-compile), human-readable/greppable when debugging sync
- Rejected: SQLite (cgo driver breaks cross-compile, pure-Go driver is a huge vendored dep, indexed queries unneeded at personal scale, binary format not inspectable); custom JSON (lossy translation away from native iCalendar format, breaks file-per-resource sync correspondence)
- `main.md`: decision added to Settled Decisions; Open Decisions rewritten as an ordered list of next decisions (architecture/package layout, build plan, sync design details, data model details, UI design, config file, housekeeping)
- `CLAUDE.md`: local cache rule added to Project Context (.ics files are the local source of truth)

---

## 2026-07-04 — TUI library decision: tview

- Chose **tview** (`rivo/tview` on `tcell`) over Bubble Tea and gocui:
  - tview: years of backwards compatibility, widgets (Table/Grid/Flex/InputField/Pages) that fit calendar/task views, k9s proves the target UX (`:` command mode, single-key shortcuts, mouse, panes)
  - Bubble Tea rejected: v2.0.0 (released 2026-07-03) is a breaking major version that also moved the module path to the vanity domain `charm.land` — churn profile conflicts with the robustness requirement
  - gocui rejected: original unmaintained; the active fork is tailored to lazygit and was recently absorbed into lazygit's own repo
- `main.md`: framework line filled in, decision + reasoning added to Settled Decisions, TUI item removed from Open Decisions
- `CLAUDE.md`: platform line updated with tview

---

## 2026-07-04 — Coding standards: Go conventions filled in

- `CLAUDE.md` "Other Conventions" section written: gofmt/goimports, `go vet` + `staticcheck` as the only linters, **vendored dependencies** (`vendor/` committed; `go mod tidy && go mod vendor` after dep changes; stdlib preferred), error wrapping with `%w` and no-panic policy, no global mutable state, Go naming + godoc comments on exports, `context.Context` on all I/O (UI must never block on network), table-driven tests with stdlib `testing` only, named constants over magic numbers
- `CLAUDE.md` workflow step 4 updated to include vet + staticcheck alongside tests
- Decisions made: vendoring chosen for build-forever robustness; staticcheck chosen over golangci-lint (less tooling churn) and over vet-only (better bug-finding)

---

## 2026-07-04 — Language decision: Go; offline-first CalDAV sync model

- Chose **Go** as the implementation language, driven by four requirements: lazygit-style interactive TUI, long-term robustness (static binary, Go 1 compatibility promise), CalDAV sync with an existing NextCloud server (the must-have feature), and speed on modest hardware (future Raspberry Pi terminal). Rust was runner-up; Python ruled out on robustness/speed.
- Chose **offline-first sync**: local cache is the working copy, NextCloud CalDAV server syncs in background/on demand.
- `main.md`: filled in language and libraries (`emersion/go-webdav`, `emersion/go-ical`, `teambition/rrule-go`; TUI lib TBD — Bubble Tea vs tview), added CalDAV sync as the top core feature, expanded design goals (`:` command mode, mouse, static-binary robustness, Pi target), added Settled Decisions section
- `CLAUDE.md`: platform line updated to Go, workflow test/run commands filled in (`go test ./...`, `go build ./...`), comment example converted to Go
- No code yet — next open decisions: TUI library, local cache storage format

---

## 2026-07-04 — Initial project structure: spec, log, and project rules

- `main.md` (new): minimal starting spec — project identity (language/libraries/license TBD), lazygit-inspired TUI description, initial core features (todo management, calendar views, recurring tasks/events), open decisions list
- `log.md` (new): change log initialized with this format
- `CLAUDE.md` (new): project context, iterative build workflow (test/run commands TBD), coding standards with Comment Rules (rest TBD), log entry format, architecture rules placeholder
- No code or tests yet — spec development is the next step
